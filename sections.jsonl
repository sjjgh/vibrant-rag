These reactions are mainly intestinal but can also occur in extra-intestinal parts of the body.1 Food-mediated reactions contribute to a leaky gut leading to chronic inflammation and disease development. The symptoms associated may include abdominal pain, hives, bloating, bowel irregularity, brain fog, headache, fatigue, muscle, and joint pain.2,3 **Uncover allergies, sensitivities, and autoimmunity to commonly consumed foods in the Western diet with Vibrant Food Reactions panels.** **Advancing age is associated with:** **increased inflammatory cytokines, a decline in the gut barrier function, and poor adaptive immunity. 4** **This increases the susceptibility to exacerbated inflammatory reactions to foods. Chronic inflammation caused by food reactions can be life-threatening and can increase the risk of a shorter lifespan. 4,5** ## Food reactions and Longevity ## Clinical Consultants ![Arturo](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Arturo.png?width=504&height=431&name=Arturo.png) #### Arturo Borzutzky, MD Arturo Borzutzky, MD, is a pediatric rheumatology specialist and is currently an Assistant Professor of Allergy, Immunology, and Pediatric Rheumatology at the School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. His research mainly focuses on the pathogenesis and treatment of atopic dermatitis, epidemiology of allergic diseases, Kawasaki disease, and pediatric autoimmunity. Dr. Borzutzky also actively studies the prevalence and manifestations of food allergies.

She has actively worked on understanding the effects of diet on human health. In one of her papers, she mentions that the identification of the food additives responsible for hypersensitivity and their treatment is challenging. However, effective diagnosis of the reaction-inducing additives can enable restricting or eliminating the food additive from one’s diet. This can help avoid food additive-mediated reactions and discomforts associated with them.8 12 ## Expert opinions ![Joseph](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Joseph.png?width=299&height=361&name=Joseph.png) #### Dr. Joseph Murray Dr. Joseph Murray, MD, is currently a Professor of Medicine, at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, and a clinician investigator and consultant in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Department of Immunology.

[ Learn More ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/autoimmune/autoimmune-zoomer) ## Test for Autoimmune Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues, causing long-term damage to organs and tissues. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease. Due to their non-specific symptoms, testing is crucial for detecting autoimmune diseases.1 Early identification and treatment are essential in preventing long-term damage. Vibrant Wellness provides autoimmune testing utilizing ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) and celiac panels. These panels identify various autoantibodies associated with autoimmunity.2 **Age is an important risk for autoimmunity, and many autoimmune diseases generally occur in the second half of adulthood when immune competence has declined, and thymic T cell generation has ceased. Many tolerance checkpoints must fail for an autoimmune disease to develop, and several of these checkpoints are susceptible to the immune aging process. 3 Some patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated immunosenescence, changes in the immune system associated with age which affects their longevity.4** ## Autoimmune diseases and longevity ## Clinical Consultants #### Dr. Matteo Colina Dr. Matteo Colina, MD, Ph.D. is a researcher who belongs to the Rheumatology Section of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of Ferrara in Italy. Dr. Matteo Colina's research primarily focuses on rheumatology. He has contributed to several studies related to bone and joint diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. One of his recent studies examined the impact of moderate physical activity on bone mineral density in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, finding that exercise can be crucial in managing the condition. In another study, Dr. Matteo Colina and his team assessed the effectiveness and safety of a new treatment for osteoarthritis and observed that it significantly alleviated pain and improved joint function in patients. Dr. Matteo Colina believes that the advancement of our understanding of bone and joint diseases has the potential to lead to the development of new and improved treatment options for these conditions.6 ![Dr. Matteo Colina](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%2010.33.23.png?width=458&height=441&name=Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%2010.33.23.png) ## Expert opinions ![Donna](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Donna.png?width=299&height=374&name=Donna.png) #### Dr. Donna Bunch Dr. Donna Bunch, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Bunch's research focuses on understanding how autoimmune diseases affect the kidney, and how abnormal B cell responses lead to the development of microparticles and cytokines that cause disease. She is particularly interested in understanding how regulatory B cells help maintain balance in the immune system and promote autoimmune disease remission. Dr. Bunch's goal is to translate our understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis into better clinical tools that can be used to predict relapse and better management of autoimmune diseases affecting the kidney.7 ![Meghan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Meghan.png?width=299&height=371&name=Meghan.png) #### Dr. Meghan Free Dr. Meghan Free, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Free’s research focuses on understanding the role of T cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Her studies have shown that regulatory T cells do not function properly in patients with this disease and that this lack of regulation leads to excess inflammation alongside autoreactive T cells. She is currently examining the potential role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in autoimmune glomerulonephritis conditions. Dr. Free believes that investigating the roles of T cells and circulating immune components would help understand their contributions to autoimmune disease progression and relapse.8 12 ## Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials #### Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects In our publication, ‘Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects’, we explored the association between autoantibodies and thyroid disease and found strong associations between autoantibodies and thyroid hormones.9 #### Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease In our study, ‘Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease’, we found that the neoepitopes derived from the tTG-DGP complex are highly accurate predictors of untreated Celiac disease mucosa. Additionally, we found that persistent immune response to these epitopes could serve as a promising non-invasive predictor of ongoing mucosal injury in patients with treated Celiac disease.10 #### Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays In our study, ‘Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays’, we used a novel method of ultra-high-density peptide microarray combined with computational methods to identify discontinuous B-cell epitopes in celiac disease patients.11 #### A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity In our study, ‘A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity’, we used our multiplex ANA + ENA panel detect multiple autoantibodies simultaneously, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of autoimmune activity.12 Reference 1.

[ Learn More ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/longevity/oxidative-stress-profile) ## Test for Longevity Research shows oxidative stress speeds up aging1 and triggers diseases like heart issues, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and inflammation. This stress damages DNA, messes with proteins, and disrupts cell signals. Our longevity support tests measure genetic variations and key markers of oxidative damage, cardiac health, inflammation, autoimmunity, nutrient status, and more to position you for optimal health and longevity. **Cellular degeneration and aging is a natural process influenced by various biological, genetic, environmental, and social factors. However, in the modern world, with daily exposure to oxidative stress and inflammatory triggers, including environmental toxins, processed foods, and stress, accelerated aging has become a prominent concern. While the average human life span has greatly increased in recent decades, this improvement has not been similarly reflected in health span. 2 Accelerated aging is directly linked to age-related diseases like neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders, inhibiting longevity.2 ** ## Accelerated Aging & Longevity ## Expert opinions ![Marilyn](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Marilyn.webp?width=376&height=299&name=Marilyn.webp) #### Dr. Marilyn Albert Dr. Marilyn Albert, Ph.D. is a professor of Neurology at Johns Hopkins, and Director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience, USA. Dr. Albert focuses on the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). She has also identified lifestyle factors that promote the maintenance of mental abilities with advancing age. In one of her papers, she mentions that the changes in cognition are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD. Understanding the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging might provide information to improve early diagnosis. Dr. Albert believes that focusing on the early identification of AD, and potential ways of monitoring the progression of the disease is needed for its early intervention.6 ![Bruce](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Bruce.webp?width=328&height=436&name=Bruce.webp) #### Dr. Bruce Ames Dr. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., has pioneered the fields of biochemistry and nutritional science. He is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the University of California, Berkeley, and most recently was a Senior Scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), and director of their Nutrition & Metabolism Center, USA. According to Dr. Ames, micronutrient deficiencies may result in chronic metabolic disruption, DNA damage, and mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging. These factors may lead to serious health conditions. Dr. Ames proposed the triage theory, which states that the body has developed a rationing response to shortages of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) throughout evolution. In nutrient deficiency states, the scarce micronutrient in the cells is allotted to proteins essential for short-term survival. Proteins needed for long-term health, including those that protect DNA, lose out and become disabled and which leads to diseases of aging. He believes that micronutrient supplementation is the way to ensure intake of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of micronutrients.5 12 ## Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials #### Oxidative Stress: Mechanisms, Quantification and Its Role in Human Aging In this review, “Oxidative Stress: Mechanisms, Quantification and Its Role in Human Aging”, we discuss how key oxidant species are generated, their sources, the beneficial roles they play at low levels, and the damage they exert at elevated levels, as well as measurement techniques for oxidative damage and key exogenous and endogenous antioxidant markers. #### Association of APOE Polymorphisms with Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers In our study, “Association of APOE Polymorphisms with Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers”, we found strong evidence linking APOE gene polymorphisms to abnormal serum lipid and inflammatory profiles that can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.

{"kind": "section", "question": "Test for Longevity", "answer": "Research shows oxidative stress speeds up aging1 and triggers diseases like heart issues, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and inflammation. This stress damages DNA, messes with proteins, and disrupts cell signals. Our longevity support tests measure genetic variations and key markers of oxidative damage, cardiac health, inflammation, autoimmunity, nutrient status, and more to position you for optimal health and longevity. **Cellular degeneration and aging is a natural process influenced by various biological, genetic, environmental, and social factors. However, in the modern world, with daily exposure to oxidative stress and inflammatory triggers, including environmental toxins, processed foods, and stress, accelerated aging has become a prominent concern. While the average human life span has greatly increased in recent decades, this improvement has not been similarly reflected in health span. 2 Accelerated aging is directly linked to age-related diseases like neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders, inhibiting longevity.2 **", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/longevity", "doc_id": "1b468a0c409f6712", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Dr. Albert focuses on the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). She has also identified lifestyle factors that promote the maintenance of mental abilities with advancing age. In one of her papers, she mentions that the changes in cognition are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD. Understanding the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging might provide information to improve early diagnosis. Dr. Albert believes that focusing on the early identification of AD, and potential ways of monitoring the progression of the disease is needed for its early intervention.6 ![Bruce](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Bruce.webp?width=328&height=436&name=Bruce.webp) #### Dr. Bruce Ames Dr. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., has pioneered the fields of biochemistry and nutritional science. He is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the University of California, Berkeley, and most recently was a Senior Scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), and director of their Nutrition & Metabolism Center, USA. According to Dr. Ames, micronutrient deficiencies may result in chronic metabolic disruption, DNA damage, and mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging. These factors may lead to serious health conditions. Dr. Ames proposed the triage theory, which states that the body has developed a rationing response to shortages of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) throughout evolution. In nutrient deficiency states, the scarce micronutrient in the cells is allotted to proteins essential for short-term survival. Proteins needed for long-term health, including those that protect DNA, lose out and become disabled and which leads to diseases of aging.

Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, healthy lifestyle habits and regular cardiac testing are essential to maintain good cardiac health.1,2 Poor cardiac health can lead to detrimental risks such as heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and even death. Vibrant offers Cardiac Health Panel, which combines multiple markers to assess current risk of heart disease and the CardiaX Test for understanding your genetic predisposition to various cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and dyslipidemia.3 **Aging results in structural changes and functional decline of the cardiovascular system and is therefore one of the major determinants of cardiovascular risks. Increasing age is accompanied by vascular stiffening, plaque formation, reduction of the bioavailability of vasodilators, an increase in vasoconstrictors, altered contractility, and poor cardiac injury repair. 4 These factors lead to the age-associated risk of atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke, thus affecting lifespan.5 ** ## Cardio Health and Longevity ## Expert opinions ![Suzette](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Suzette.png?width=310&height=371&name=Suzette.png) #### Dr. Suzette Bielinski Dr. Suzette Bielinski, Ph.D., M.Ed., is a genetic epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota. Dr. Suzette Bielinski research focuses on identifying molecular biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors, as well as understanding the role of genetic variants in drug response. She has identified genetic and protein biomarkers and other clinical factors associated with heart disease, including heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms, that can be used to improve risk prediction. Dr. Suzette Bielinski believes that understanding individual differences in cardiovascular disease holds the promise of improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease by tailoring medical care to an individual's molecular profile.6 ![Michael](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Michael.png?width=307&height=295&name=Michael.png) #### Dr. Michael J.

His research interests include studying genomics and genotype-phenotype relationships in heritable cardiovascular diseases predisposing to sudden death. Dr. Ackerman and his colleagues have discovered more than 12 genes that can lead to sudden death. This research is now being used to develop genetic tests that can help identify patients who are at risk for developing heart disease and sudden death.

[ Learn More ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/autoimmune/autoimmune-zoomer) ## Test for Autoimmune Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues, causing long-term damage to organs and tissues. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease. Due to their non-specific symptoms, testing is crucial for detecting autoimmune diseases.1 Early identification and treatment are essential in preventing long-term damage. Vibrant Wellness provides autoimmune testing utilizing ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) and celiac panels. These panels identify various autoantibodies associated with autoimmunity.2 **Age is an important risk for autoimmunity, and many autoimmune diseases generally occur in the second half of adulthood when immune competence has declined, and thymic T cell generation has ceased. Many tolerance checkpoints must fail for an autoimmune disease to develop, and several of these checkpoints are susceptible to the immune aging process. 3 Some patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated immunosenescence, changes in the immune system associated with age which affects their longevity.4** ## Autoimmune diseases and longevity ## Clinical Consultants #### Dr. Matteo Colina Dr. Matteo Colina, MD, Ph.D. is a researcher who belongs to the Rheumatology Section of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of Ferrara in Italy. Dr. Matteo Colina's research primarily focuses on rheumatology. He has contributed to several studies related to bone and joint diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. One of his recent studies examined the impact of moderate physical activity on bone mineral density in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, finding that exercise can be crucial in managing the condition. In another study, Dr. Matteo Colina and his team assessed the effectiveness and safety of a new treatment for osteoarthritis and observed that it significantly alleviated pain and improved joint function in patients. Dr. Matteo Colina believes that the advancement of our understanding of bone and joint diseases has the potential to lead to the development of new and improved treatment options for these conditions.6 ![Dr. Matteo Colina](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%2010.33.23.png?width=458&height=441&name=Screenshot%202025-03-05%20at%2010.33.23.png) ## Expert opinions ![Donna](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Donna.png?width=299&height=374&name=Donna.png) #### Dr. Donna Bunch Dr. Donna Bunch, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Bunch's research focuses on understanding how autoimmune diseases affect the kidney, and how abnormal B cell responses lead to the development of microparticles and cytokines that cause disease. She is particularly interested in understanding how regulatory B cells help maintain balance in the immune system and promote autoimmune disease remission. Dr. Bunch's goal is to translate our understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis into better clinical tools that can be used to predict relapse and better management of autoimmune diseases affecting the kidney.7 ![Meghan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Consultants/Meghan.png?width=299&height=371&name=Meghan.png) #### Dr. Meghan Free Dr. Meghan Free, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Free’s research focuses on understanding the role of T cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Her studies have shown that regulatory T cells do not function properly in patients with this disease and that this lack of regulation leads to excess inflammation alongside autoreactive T cells. She is currently examining the potential role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in autoimmune glomerulonephritis conditions. Dr. Free believes that investigating the roles of T cells and circulating immune components would help understand their contributions to autoimmune disease progression and relapse.8 12 ## Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials #### Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects In our publication, ‘Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects’, we explored the association between autoantibodies and thyroid disease and found strong associations between autoantibodies and thyroid hormones.9 #### Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease In our study, ‘Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease’, we found that the neoepitopes derived from the tTG-DGP complex are highly accurate predictors of untreated Celiac disease mucosa. Additionally, we found that persistent immune response to these epitopes could serve as a promising non-invasive predictor of ongoing mucosal injury in patients with treated Celiac disease.10 #### Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays In our study, ‘Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays’, we used a novel method of ultra-high-density peptide microarray combined with computational methods to identify discontinuous B-cell epitopes in celiac disease patients.11 #### A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity In our study, ‘A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity’, we used our multiplex ANA + ENA panel detect multiple autoantibodies simultaneously, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of autoimmune activity.12 Reference 1.

{"kind": "section", "question": "Test for Autoimmune", "answer": "Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues, causing long-term damage to organs and tissues. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease. Due to their non-specific symptoms, testing is crucial for detecting autoimmune diseases.1 Early identification and treatment are essential in preventing long-term damage. Vibrant Wellness provides autoimmune testing utilizing ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) and celiac panels. These panels identify various autoantibodies associated with autoimmunity.2 **Age is an important risk for autoimmunity, and many autoimmune diseases generally occur in the second half of adulthood when immune competence has declined, and thymic T cell generation has ceased. Many tolerance checkpoints must fail for an autoimmune disease to develop, and several of these checkpoints are susceptible to the immune aging process. 3 Some patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated immunosenescence, changes in the immune system associated with age which affects their longevity.4**", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/autoimmune", "doc_id": "2873184e970fd0c4", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Medication & Supplement Considerations: No restrictions; however, consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns about ongoing medications or supplements that may influence nutrient levels. **3. Best Collection Practices:** Ensure the sample is properly sealed and stored according to the provided instructions. Follow all collection procedures as directed to ensure accurate results. **4. Seamless Sample Processing:** Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for comprehensive analysis, and work with your healthcare provider to interpret your results and develop a personalized nutrition and wellness plan based on your unique genetic and micronutrient profile. Why Is This Important Many people have genetic variations that affect how they metabolize and absorb nutrients, potentially leading to deficiencies or imbalances that affect overall health. The NutriPro panel evaluates genetic variations related to nutrient metabolism and absorption, helping individuals understand how their body processes essential vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. Testing for genetic factors in nutrient metabolism allows healthcare providers to recommend personalized supplementation and dietary changes to optimize nutrient intake. Understanding your genetic predispositions to nutrient needs helps prevent deficiencies, improve energy levels, and support immune and metabolic function. With personalized insights into your nutritional needs, NutriPro helps optimize diet and supplementation to support long-term health, reduce disease risk, and improve vitality. Genetic testing for nutrient metabolism helps design individualized nutrition plans, ensuring that the body receives the nutrients it needs to function optimally.

Declining estrogen and progesterone levels raise risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, sleep issues, low libido, muscle loss, reduced collagen, cognitive changes, mood swings, and weight gain. The Hormone Zoomer assesses hormone levels and its metabolites highlighting risk profiles, while adrenal HPA axis evaluation refines treatment options for stress management thereby supporting women to navigate this life stage with greater support and resilience. _Fertility and reproductive health_ For women with fertility issues, PCOS, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, irregular cycles, or endometriosis, the Hormone Zoomer Test assesses adrenal and reproductive hormone imbalances, pinpointing disruptions to help guide tailored treatment. _Estrogen Dominance_ Estrogen dominance occurs when estrogen levels are high relative to progesterone. This imbalance can worsen symptoms of PMS, painful periods, endometriosis, and fibroids, and can make perimenopause symptoms more intense. _Estrogen Metabolism and Cancer Risk_ The Hormone Zoomer Test can help understand how your liver metabolizes estrogen. Poor estrogen metabolism can increase the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, cervical, and uterine cancer. #### Male Hormones Testosterone metabolism by 5-alpha reductase can lead to pattern baldness by converting testosterone to DHT, while endocrine disruptors may blunt testosterone’s key effects, such as muscle maintenance or libido, altering its intended function despite normal levels. #### Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT) For anyone starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or already on it, monitoring hormone levels and their metabolites is vital. The Hormone Zoomer Test evaluates testosterone for men, from injections, patches, pellets, or gels and estrogen or progesterone for women—from oral doses, vaginal applications, patches, or pellets, ensuring tailored decisions working with your provider. #### Detox Endocrine Disruptors Detect toxins that can block hormone receptors and provide lifestyle and supplement suggestions to help and support detox pathways. #### Sleep Issues If you’re experiencing sleep disturbances, the Hormone Zoomer Test can provide insight by evaluating diurnal melatonin and cortisol patterns. Reduced melatonin or elevated cortisol levels may dysregulate your circadian rhythm, impairing sleep quality. #### DHEA deficiency or excess DHEA, an adrenal hormone, affects health broadly with low levels leading to fatigue, depression, muscle loss, joint pain, low libido, and weak immunity, while high levels may cause acne and excess hair growth. As a precursor to sex hormones, its balance is key. Testing DHEA levels along with its circulating form DHEA-S sheds light on overall adrenal and hormonal health. ## Vibrant Advantage The Hormone Zoomer offers a comprehensive evaluation of hormone levels, including cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and endocrine disruptors, helping identify imbalances that impact mood, energy, metabolism, and overall health. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/lab%20\\(1\\)%203.svg) Uses LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS methods for highly sensitive, lab-grade hormone and toxin detection, delivering precise results providers can trust for clinical decision-making. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/BPA.svg) Identifies endocrine-disrupting toxins like BPA and phthalates that interfere with hormone receptor binding, helping explain unresolved symptoms and poor response to therapy. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/hormones%201.svg) Early detection of hormonal imbalances allows individuals to take proactive steps, including lifestyle changes or therapies, to restore balance and improve health. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/content-strategy%201.svg) Supports personalized hormone management strategies to optimize energy levels, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being by addressing hormonal dysfunction early.

Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day. #### Why are hormone metabolism markers important? Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns. #### Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working? Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.” #### Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks? Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption. #### Will the report include treatment suggestions? Yes. Every report includes clinical context, visual trend graphs, metabolic ratios, and built-in supplement recommendations based on the patient's hormone profile, making it easy to create a targeted, personalized care plan. ## How it works ![Process1-1](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process1-1.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process1-1.png) 1 #### Order Your Test Your wellness provider orders your lab test ![Process2](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process2.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process2.png) 2 #### Activate Your Kit Scan the QR CODE to activate your kit. ![Process3](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Process3.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process3.png) 3 #### Collect Your Sample Follow the instructions included in your test kit to collect your sample. ![Process4](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process4.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process4.png) 4 #### Ship Immediately Ship your sample to our lab team for analysis. ![Process5](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process5.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process5.png) 5 #### Receive Personalized Results Receive your personalized report within 2-3 weeks.

Declining estrogen and progesterone levels raise risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, sleep issues, low libido, muscle loss, reduced collagen, cognitive changes, mood swings, and weight gain. The Hormone Zoomer assesses hormone levels and its metabolites highlighting risk profiles, while adrenal HPA axis evaluation refines treatment options for stress management thereby supporting women to navigate this life stage with greater support and resilience. _Fertility and reproductive health_ For women with fertility issues, PCOS, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, irregular cycles, or endometriosis, the Hormone Zoomer Test assesses adrenal and reproductive hormone imbalances, pinpointing disruptions to help guide tailored treatment. _Estrogen Dominance_ Estrogen dominance occurs when estrogen levels are high relative to progesterone. This imbalance can worsen symptoms of PMS, painful periods, endometriosis, and fibroids, and can make perimenopause symptoms more intense. _Estrogen Metabolism and Cancer Risk_ The Hormone Zoomer Test can help understand how your liver metabolizes estrogen. Poor estrogen metabolism can increase the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, cervical, and uterine cancer. #### Male Hormones Testosterone metabolism by 5-alpha reductase can lead to pattern baldness by converting testosterone to DHT, while endocrine disruptors may blunt testosterone’s key effects, such as muscle maintenance or libido, altering its intended function despite normal levels. #### Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT) For anyone starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or already on it, monitoring hormone levels and their metabolites is vital. The Hormone Zoomer Test evaluates testosterone for men, from injections, patches, pellets, or gels and estrogen or progesterone for women—from oral doses, vaginal applications, patches, or pellets, ensuring tailored decisions working with your provider. #### Detox Endocrine Disruptors Detect toxins that can block hormone receptors and provide lifestyle and supplement suggestions to help and support detox pathways. #### Sleep Issues If you’re experiencing sleep disturbances, the Hormone Zoomer Test can provide insight by evaluating diurnal melatonin and cortisol patterns. Reduced melatonin or elevated cortisol levels may dysregulate your circadian rhythm, impairing sleep quality. #### DHEA deficiency or excess DHEA, an adrenal hormone, affects health broadly with low levels leading to fatigue, depression, muscle loss, joint pain, low libido, and weak immunity, while high levels may cause acne and excess hair growth. As a precursor to sex hormones, its balance is key. Testing DHEA levels along with its circulating form DHEA-S sheds light on overall adrenal and hormonal health.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/hormones/urinary-hormones-panel", "doc_id": "7fe183748fbc5f5b", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day. #### Why are hormone metabolism markers important? Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns. #### Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working? Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.” #### Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks? Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption. #### Will the report include treatment suggestions? Yes. Every report includes clinical context, visual trend graphs, metabolic ratios, and built-in supplement recommendations based on the patient's hormone profile, making it easy to create a targeted, personalized care plan.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/hormones/urinary-hormones-panel", "doc_id": "7fe183748fbc5f5b", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

A marginal lack of a particular nutrient could prove detrimental to the body and could lead to health conditions.1 **Vibrant’s Nutrient test assesses the extracellular and intracellular levels of nutrients as well as genetic predispositions affecting nutrient levels, revealing the root cause of nutritional deficiencies.** **Nutrition impacts overall wellbeing.** **A deficiency in B vitamins has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, immune alterations, and inflammatory conditions which can give rise to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, cognitive dysfunction, osteoporosis, and methylation disorders. 2 ** **Also, a vitamin E deficiency can reduce cognitive functions, which is implicated in brain aging. 3** ## Nutrition and Ageing ## Expert opinions ![Bruce](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Bruce.webp?width=328&height=436&name=Bruce.webp) #### Dr. Bruce Ames Dr. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., has pioneered the fields of biochemistry and nutritional science. He is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the University of California, Berkeley, and most recently was a Senior Scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), and director of their Nutrition & Metabolism Center, USA. According to Dr. Ames, micronutrient deficiencies may result in chronic metabolic disruption, DNA damage, and mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging. These factors may lead to serious health conditions. Dr. Ames proposed the triage theory, which states that the body has developed a rationing response to shortages of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) throughout evolution. In nutrient deficiency states, the scarce micronutrient in the cells is allotted to proteins essential for short-term survival. Proteins needed for long-term health, including those that protect DNA, lose out and become disabled and which leads to diseases of aging. He believes that micronutrient supplementation is the way to ensure intake of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of micronutrients5. ![Regan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Regan.png?width=335&height=444&name=Regan.png) #### Regan Bailey Regan Bailey, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D. is an Associate Director of Precision Nutrition for the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture and a professor of Nutrition at Texas A&M University, USA.

A marginal lack of a particular nutrient could prove detrimental to the body and could lead to health conditions.1 **Vibrant’s Nutrient test assesses the extracellular and intracellular levels of nutrients as well as genetic predispositions affecting nutrient levels, revealing the root cause of nutritional deficiencies.** **Nutrition impacts overall wellbeing.** **A deficiency in B vitamins has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, immune alterations, and inflammatory conditions which can give rise to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, cognitive dysfunction, osteoporosis, and methylation disorders. 2 ** **Also, a vitamin E deficiency can reduce cognitive functions, which is implicated in brain aging. 3**", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/nutrients", "doc_id": "ade2856de6ee8c35", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Hormones are synthesized by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream.1 Hormonal imbalance can affect metabolism resulting in weight gain, fatigue, slow heartbeat. It can also accelerate aging. Vibrant America has Hormones Panel which helps determine the status of reproductive, metabolic, and steroid hormones and metabolites and uncover hormonal imbalances and hormone-related diseases. **The endocrine system and hormones maintain and regulate several factors like metabolism, reproduction, response to stress, growth, etc. Hence, hormones play a key role in longevity and aging. 2 Reproductive hormones like androgens and estrogens and thyroid hormones can influence longevity. Decrease in the hormones with age changes metabolism, cellular interactions, and growth which can accelerate aging.3** ## Hormones and Longevity ## Clinical Consultants #### Dr. James Roney James Roney, Ph.D. is a professor in the department of Phycology and brain Sciences at the University of California, USA. His research focuses on human endocrinology and how hormones produce coordinated output effects that are adaptive responses to specific input conditions. Dr. Roney has worked on how reactive hormone increases during encounters with potential mates and how women’s motivational priorities changes can be predicted according to the shift in ovarian hormones across menstrual cycle.4 ![James](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/James.png?width=410&height=394&name=James.png) ## Expert opinions ![Liou](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Liou.png?width=299&height=436&name=Liou.png) #### Dr. Liou Y.

His research is focused on how nutrition and hormones during early development can influence long-term health and age-related diseases. Hormones play a role in aging and understanding this mechanism can help to improve longevity and reduce the development of age-related disorders. Dr. Sun is also studying interventions for age-related disorders 5. ![Andrzej](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Andrzej.png?width=299&height=299&name=Andrzej.png) #### Dr. Andrzej Bartke Dr. Andrzej Bartke, Ph.D. is a professor of internal medicine and physiology at the Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine in Springfield, USA. His research is mainly focused on genetic and hormonal control of aging in mammals. He has published several papers on hormonal control of aging and longevity. Hormones heavily influence aging and hormonal imbalance can lead to age-related disorders. Hence, his work on hormonal control of aging is extremely important. He is currently working on growth hormone and its effects on aging and longevity.6 12 ## Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials #### Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism In our study ‘Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism’ we have explained in detail the pathology of thyroid imbalance in the context of human reproductive health, autoimmunity, and micronutrient imbalance..7 #### Human Reproductive Health in Relation to Thyroid Alterations In the study ‘Human Reproductive Health in Relation to Thyroid Alterations’ we showed that different thyroid alterations have different effects on the reproductive health of men and women. Based on this study, we encourage individuals to frequently test for reproductive and related hormones as individuals can be susceptible to thyroid disease.8 #### Significance of anti-TPO as an early predictive marker in thyroid disease In the study ‘Significance of anti-TPO as an early predictive marker in thyroid disease’ we showed that anti-TPO levels were high prior to the onset of thyroid hormone dysfunction. Hence, testing for anti-TPO along with TSH can help in identifying high-risk individuals and help to reduce long-term morbidity.9 #### Effect of micronutrients on thyroid parameters In the study ‘Effect of micronutrients on thyroid parameters’ we observed that the deficiency in essential micronutrients results in extreme derangement in thyroid functioning. Serum levels of amino acids like asparagine, serine, valine, leucine, and arginine are related to thyroid functioning.10 Reference 1. Hiller-Sturmhöfel, S., & Bartke, A. (1998).

Simple Testing Process:** Follow our step-by-step instructions to complete this urine test at home. **2. Pre-Test Guidelines:** * No fasting required, but fasting for 12–24 hours before testing may increase the excretion of mycotoxins and environmental toxins from adipose tissue. * **Hydration Considerations:** Do not drink more than 8 oz of water one hour before urine collection, as overly diluted urine may result in sample rejection. * **Dietary Considerations:** Avoid foods high in iodine (seafood, dairy, kelp) and selenium (Brazil nuts) for 48 hours before collection. These nutrients bind to heavy metals and may lower detectable levels. * **Medication & Supplement Considerations:** No restrictions; however, consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance. **3. Best Collection Practices:** * Collect your first-morning urine sample upon awakening. Ensure the sample is properly sealed and stored according to the provided instructions. **4.

Simple Testing Process:** Follow our step-by-step instructions to complete this urine test at home. **2. Pre-Test Guidelines:** * No fasting required, but fasting for 12–24 hours before testing may increase the excretion of mycotoxins and environmental toxins from adipose tissue. * **Hydration Considerations:** Do not drink more than 8 oz of water one hour before urine collection, as overly diluted urine may result in sample rejection. * **Dietary Considerations:** Avoid foods high in iodine (seafood, dairy, kelp) and selenium (Brazil nuts) for 48 hours before collection. These nutrients bind to heavy metals and may lower detectable levels. * **Medication & Supplement Considerations:** No restrictions; however, consult with your healthcare provider for personalized guidance. **3. Best Collection Practices:** * Collect your first-morning urine sample upon awakening. Ensure the sample is properly sealed and stored according to the provided instructions. **4. Seamless Sample Processing:** Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for comprehensive analysis, and work with your healthcare provider to interpret your results and develop a personalized plan to reduce toxin exposure and support detoxification. Why Is This Important Environmental toxins, including mycotoxins, heavy metals, and industrial chemicals, accumulate in the body over time and contribute to chronic health issues like autoimmune diseases, cancer, and neurological disorders. Toxic exposure is often linked to chronic inflammation, metabolic imbalance, and immune dysfunction, making it important to identify these toxins early before they cause lasting damage. The Total Tox Burden Test measures a wide range of toxins in the body, including mycotoxins, heavy metals, and environmental chemicals, providing a detailed look at your toxic load. By detecting toxins early, individuals can take action to reduce exposure, protect health, and optimize detoxification processes to prevent long-term complications. Reducing toxic burden through targeted detoxification strategies can significantly improve energy levels, immune function, and reduce inflammation. The test helps healthcare providers develop personalized detox plans to eliminate harmful substances from the body and restore health.

Preserving optimal neural health is crucial in preventing cognitive decline and reducing the likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases.1 Neural health testing enables early detection of potential neural health issues, monitoring over time, and personalized interventions, making it essential for maintaining good neural health. **Vibrant Wellness provides the Neural Zoomer Plus Test, which evaluates reactivity to neurological antigens associated with various neurologically related diseases.** **Neural health gradually deteriorates with age, resulting in structural and neurophysiological alterations as well as a reduction in cognitive ability. 3 During aging, the neural cellular environment exhibits evidence of compromised bioenergetics, impaired adaptive neuroplasticity, and a vulnerability to excessive neural activity. This results in the accumulation of damaged neural molecules and organelles, inflammation, and a loss of cognitive abilities, all of which have been shown to affect longevity.3,4** ## Neural health and longevity ## Clinical Consultants ![Stojan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Stojan.png?width=398&height=383&name=Stojan.png) #### Dr. Stojan Peric Dr. Stojan Peric, MD, Ph.D. is a teaching assistant and neurologist at the Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Center of Serbia.

Dr. Albert focuses on the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). She has also identified lifestyle factors that promote the maintenance of mental abilities with advancing age. In one of her papers, she mentions that the changes in cognition are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD. Understanding the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging might provide information to improve early diagnosis. Dr. Albert believes that focusing on the early identification of AD, and potential ways of monitoring the progression of the disease is needed for its early intervention.6 ![Vikram](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Vikram.png?width=307&height=295&name=Vikram.png) #### Dr. Vikram Khurana Dr. Vikram Khurana, Ph.D. is the Chief of the Division of Movement Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and Principal Faculty at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, USA.

Pathogens and their toxins are transmitted to a susceptible host via an infected person, animal, or contaminated object.1 Infectious diseases result in an immense global burden that can impact public health and economies.2 Infections can be contracted through environmental sources or human contact and can wreak havoc on various body systems. If not diagnosed, infections can cause chronic inflammation, disease development, and even neurological symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the transmission and impact of infectious diseases. **Vibrant has an Infection Panel that can readily detect the presence of various classes of microbes, revealing the root cause of symptoms.** **Infections play a role in longevity. It has been hypothesized that exposure to infectious diseases during the early stages of life can increase the risk of mortality. 3 Infections cause inflammatory immune reactions and chronic inflammation can increase the risk of atherosclerosis, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. Several studies have associated the chronic inflammation caused due to early-life infections with cardiovascular diseases and increased middle-aged mortality.4** ## Infections and longevity ## Clinical Consultants ![Patrick](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Patrick.png?width=509&height=448&name=Patrick.png) #### Dr. Patrick Meyer Patrick M Meyer Sauteur, MD, Ph.D. is part of the University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. His research focuses on pneumonia in children, mycoplasma, Lyme disease, and acute monocutaneous reactions to infections. Mycoplasma pneumonia and Lyme disease are serious infections that can be considered endemic in the USA. Understanding these diseases can help improve diagnostic methods and treatment for the same. Dr. Meyer has worked on and published several papers on Mycoplasma pneumonia.6 Furthermore, he has collaborated with Vibrant America in studying Lyme disease. ## Expert opinions ![Niaz](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Niaz.webp?width=329&height=325&name=Niaz.webp) #### Dr. Niaz Banaei Niaz Banaei, MD is a Professor of Pathology and Medicine at Stanford University and is the Director of the Stanford Clinical Microbiology Fellowship and Stanford Global Health Diagnostics Fellowship. He is also the associate program director for the Clinical Pathology training program. His research focuses on the development, assessment, improvement, and clinical impact of novel infectious diseases diagnostics, and immunopathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. Dr. Banaei has worked on and published papers on several infectious diseases including but not limited to Sars-Cov-2, M. tuberculosis, etc.7 ## Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials #### Antibody Profiling and Prevalence in the US population during the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic In the study ‘Antibody Profiling and Prevalence in the US population during the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic’ we employed our microarray technology to detect Sars-Cov-2. The method had high sensitivity and specificity, scalability, high fidelity, and reliability which will be critical to the control of the current pandemic.9 #### Serology profile and effects of influenza vaccination on COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’ In our publication ‘Serology profile and effects of influenza vaccination on COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’ we reported that the influenza vaccine does not provide protection against Sars-Cov-2 but may attenuate symptom severity.10 #### An ultra-high‑density protein microarray for high throughput single‑tier serological detection of Lyme disease In the study 'An ultra‑high‑density protein microarray for high throughput single‑tier serological detection of Lyme disease’ we demonstrated that the Lyme Immunochip is a valid alternative to standard two-tiered testing, with the capability to characterize the antibody profile of Lyme disease patients with enhanced accuracy and reduced turnaround time. Our microarray has the potential to be an accurate, rapid, economical, and universal diagnostic testing platform.11 #### A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients In the publication ‘A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’ we used our microarray technology to detect antibodies against Sars-Cov-2.12 Reference 1.

Toxins That Act as Endocrine Disruptors * Identify**hormone-disrupting toxins** that interfere with hormone and receptor function, potentially reducing the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). * **BPA, phthalates, and parabens:** These environmental toxins can bind to estrogen and androgen receptors, disrupting normal hormonal signaling and balance. ##### Sample Report [ Download Hormone Zoomer Sample Report ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/Tests/Hormone-Zoomer/Hormone-Zoomer-Sample-Report-Full-Report-Female.pdf) [ Download Sample Report ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/Tests/Hormone-Zoomer/Hormone-Zoomer-Sample-Report-Full-Report-Female.pdf) ##### Sample Type Urine [ Explore Collection Instruction ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/for-patients/collection/urine-4-tubes) ##### NY State Available No ##### You may benefit from this test if you have: Menopause Frequent fatigue or low energy Unexplained weight gain or loss Difficulty sleeping or insomnia Mood swings or irritability Hot flashes or night sweats Hair Loss Chronic acne Back pain, joint pain or stiffness Reduced libido Irregular periods/ PCOS Muscle weakness Increased stress Difficulty concentrating or remembering [ ![PdfDown-2](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/PdfDown-2.svg) View Hormones Publications and Resources ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/technology/science-research) ## Precision Testing You Can Trust All of our laboratory tests are performed in a CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited facility in California ![CMSWhite](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/CMSWhite.webp?width=412&height=180&name=CMSWhite.webp) ![HIPAAWhite](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HIPAAWhite.webp?width=360&height=180&name=HIPAAWhite.webp) ## Provides Decisive Action with Personalized Insights The Hormone Zoomer empowers you with actionable insights into hormone balance, toxic burden, and oxidative stress, helping you optimize energy, metabolism, mood, and overall well-being for an extended healthspan and more vibrant life. ![Bone Health Framed](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Bone%20Health%20Framed.png?width=1080&height=1080&name=Bone%20Health%20Framed.png) ## Why Order the Hormone Zoomer ![Hormone-Zoomer-Symptoms](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tests/Hormone-Zoomer/Images/Hormone-Zoomer-Symptoms.png?width=2000&height=2000&name=Hormone-Zoomer-Symptoms.png) #### Female Hormones _Menopause and Perimenopause_ The perimenopause-to-menopause transition is a key phase in women’s health. Declining estrogen and progesterone levels raise risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, sleep issues, low libido, muscle loss, reduced collagen, cognitive changes, mood swings, and weight gain. The Hormone Zoomer assesses hormone levels and its metabolites highlighting risk profiles, while adrenal HPA axis evaluation refines treatment options for stress management thereby supporting women to navigate this life stage with greater support and resilience. _Fertility and reproductive health_ For women with fertility issues, PCOS, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, irregular cycles, or endometriosis, the Hormone Zoomer Test assesses adrenal and reproductive hormone imbalances, pinpointing disruptions to help guide tailored treatment. _Estrogen Dominance_ Estrogen dominance occurs when estrogen levels are high relative to progesterone. This imbalance can worsen symptoms of PMS, painful periods, endometriosis, and fibroids, and can make perimenopause symptoms more intense. _Estrogen Metabolism and Cancer Risk_ The Hormone Zoomer Test can help understand how your liver metabolizes estrogen. Poor estrogen metabolism can increase the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, cervical, and uterine cancer. #### Male Hormones Testosterone metabolism by 5-alpha reductase can lead to pattern baldness by converting testosterone to DHT, while endocrine disruptors may blunt testosterone’s key effects, such as muscle maintenance or libido, altering its intended function despite normal levels. #### Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT) For anyone starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or already on it, monitoring hormone levels and their metabolites is vital. The Hormone Zoomer Test evaluates testosterone for men, from injections, patches, pellets, or gels and estrogen or progesterone for women—from oral doses, vaginal applications, patches, or pellets, ensuring tailored decisions working with your provider. #### Detox Endocrine Disruptors Detect toxins that can block hormone receptors and provide lifestyle and supplement suggestions to help and support detox pathways. #### Sleep Issues If you’re experiencing sleep disturbances, the Hormone Zoomer Test can provide insight by evaluating diurnal melatonin and cortisol patterns. Reduced melatonin or elevated cortisol levels may dysregulate your circadian rhythm, impairing sleep quality. #### DHEA deficiency or excess DHEA, an adrenal hormone, affects health broadly with low levels leading to fatigue, depression, muscle loss, joint pain, low libido, and weak immunity, while high levels may cause acne and excess hair growth. As a precursor to sex hormones, its balance is key. Testing DHEA levels along with its circulating form DHEA-S sheds light on overall adrenal and hormonal health. ## Vibrant Advantage The Hormone Zoomer offers a comprehensive evaluation of hormone levels, including cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and endocrine disruptors, helping identify imbalances that impact mood, energy, metabolism, and overall health. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/lab%20\\(1\\)%203.svg) Uses LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS methods for highly sensitive, lab-grade hormone and toxin detection, delivering precise results providers can trust for clinical decision-making. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/BPA.svg) Identifies endocrine-disrupting toxins like BPA and phthalates that interfere with hormone receptor binding, helping explain unresolved symptoms and poor response to therapy. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/hormones%201.svg) Early detection of hormonal imbalances allows individuals to take proactive steps, including lifestyle changes or therapies, to restore balance and improve health. ![](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hubfs/content-strategy%201.svg) Supports personalized hormone management strategies to optimize energy levels, reduce stress, and enhance overall well-being by addressing hormonal dysfunction early.

What’s Measured Analyzes gut microbes, digestive health markers, and pathogens that may influence beta-glucuronidase activity, estrogen recirculation, hormone metabolism, and inflammation. ## FAQs for Hormone Zoomer [ View all FAQs ](https://help.vibrant-wellness.com/hc/en-us?__hstc=233546881.0e35fa1f685a9e19e07c584410315c97.1741705001418.1741711860667.1741717824855.3&__hssc=233546881.8.1741717824855&__hsfp=3970764857) #### What makes the Hormone Zoomer different from other hormone tests? Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day. #### Why are hormone metabolism markers important? Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns. #### Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working? Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.” #### Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks? Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption. #### Will the report include treatment suggestions? Yes. Every report includes clinical context, visual trend graphs, metabolic ratios, and built-in supplement recommendations based on the patient's hormone profile, making it easy to create a targeted, personalized care plan. ## How it works ![Process1-1](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process1-1.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process1-1.png) 1 #### Order Your Test Your wellness provider orders your lab test ![Process2](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process2.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process2.png) 2 #### Activate Your Kit Scan the QR CODE to activate your kit. ![Process3](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Process3.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process3.png) 3 #### Collect Your Sample Follow the instructions included in your test kit to collect your sample. ![Process4](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process4.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process4.png) 4 #### Ship Immediately Ship your sample to our lab team for analysis. ![Process5](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Process5.png?width=152&height=152&name=Process5.png) 5 #### Receive Personalized Results Receive your personalized report within 2-3 weeks.

Declining estrogen and progesterone levels raise risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, sleep issues, low libido, muscle loss, reduced collagen, cognitive changes, mood swings, and weight gain. The Hormone Zoomer assesses hormone levels and its metabolites highlighting risk profiles, while adrenal HPA axis evaluation refines treatment options for stress management thereby supporting women to navigate this life stage with greater support and resilience. _Fertility and reproductive health_ For women with fertility issues, PCOS, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, irregular cycles, or endometriosis, the Hormone Zoomer Test assesses adrenal and reproductive hormone imbalances, pinpointing disruptions to help guide tailored treatment. _Estrogen Dominance_ Estrogen dominance occurs when estrogen levels are high relative to progesterone. This imbalance can worsen symptoms of PMS, painful periods, endometriosis, and fibroids, and can make perimenopause symptoms more intense. _Estrogen Metabolism and Cancer Risk_ The Hormone Zoomer Test can help understand how your liver metabolizes estrogen. Poor estrogen metabolism can increase the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, cervical, and uterine cancer. #### Male Hormones Testosterone metabolism by 5-alpha reductase can lead to pattern baldness by converting testosterone to DHT, while endocrine disruptors may blunt testosterone’s key effects, such as muscle maintenance or libido, altering its intended function despite normal levels. #### Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT) For anyone starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or already on it, monitoring hormone levels and their metabolites is vital. The Hormone Zoomer Test evaluates testosterone for men, from injections, patches, pellets, or gels and estrogen or progesterone for women—from oral doses, vaginal applications, patches, or pellets, ensuring tailored decisions working with your provider. #### Detox Endocrine Disruptors Detect toxins that can block hormone receptors and provide lifestyle and supplement suggestions to help and support detox pathways. #### Sleep Issues If you’re experiencing sleep disturbances, the Hormone Zoomer Test can provide insight by evaluating diurnal melatonin and cortisol patterns. Reduced melatonin or elevated cortisol levels may dysregulate your circadian rhythm, impairing sleep quality. #### DHEA deficiency or excess DHEA, an adrenal hormone, affects health broadly with low levels leading to fatigue, depression, muscle loss, joint pain, low libido, and weak immunity, while high levels may cause acne and excess hair growth. As a precursor to sex hormones, its balance is key. Testing DHEA levels along with its circulating form DHEA-S sheds light on overall adrenal and hormonal health.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/hormones/hormone-zoomer", "doc_id": "ec0bf07b38700796", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day. #### Why are hormone metabolism markers important? Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns. #### Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working? Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.” #### Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks? Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption. #### Will the report include treatment suggestions? Yes.

Simple Sample Collection:** Follow the provided instructions to collect a stool sample using the designated collection kit. The process is non-invasive and can be completed in the comfort of your home. **2**.**Pre-Test Guidelines:** * No fasting required—continue your regular diet. * Dietary Considerations: Maintain your usual eating habits before testing, as microbiome composition is influenced by diet. Avoid recent use of antibiotics unless instructed by your healthcare provider. * Medication & Supplement Considerations: No restrictions, but certain medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) or probiotics may influence results. Consult your provider if needed. **3. Comprehensive Gut Health Analysis:** Measures over 200 gut bacteria and pathogens to assess microbiome balance. Evaluates digestive markers, inflammation levels, and gut permeability (leaky gut). Detects opportunistic bacteria, fungi, viruses, and antibiotic resistance genes for a full-spectrum gut health assessment. **4. Seamless Sample Processing:** Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for in-depth analysis using real-time PCR, ELISA, LC-MS, and GC-MS technologies for precise microbial and metabolic profiling. **Personalized Insights & Recommendations: **Your healthcare provider will receive a detailed report highlighting microbial imbalances, digestive function, and inflammation levels. Results can help guide dietary, probiotic, and lifestyle recommendations to support optimal gut health. Microbial imbalances can drive symptoms like bloating, fatigue, brain fog, and inflammation, even in the absence of overt GI disease. Low microbial diversity is linked to poor immune resilience, higher risk of chronic disease, and reduced ability to adapt to stressors. Intestinal permeability allows toxins and food particles to enter the bloodstream, potentially triggering autoimmune responses and systemic inflammation. Early detection of gut inflammation helps prevent progression to more serious issues like IBD, food intolerances, or immune dysregulation. Impaired digestion and malabsorption can lead to nutrient deficiencies that impact energy, hormone balance, cognition, and skin health. A well-balanced gut microbiome supports detoxification, hormone metabolism, immune balance, and overall vitality, making it foundational to long-term wellness. ![Sample

Simple Sample Collection:** Follow the provided instructions to collect a stool sample using the designated collection kit. The process is non-invasive and can be completed in the comfort of your home. **2**.**Pre-Test Guidelines:** * No fasting required—continue your regular diet. * Dietary Considerations: Maintain your usual eating habits before testing, as microbiome composition is influenced by diet. Avoid recent use of antibiotics unless instructed by your healthcare provider. * Medication & Supplement Considerations: No restrictions, but certain medications (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) or probiotics may influence results. Consult your provider if needed. **3. Comprehensive Gut Health Analysis:** Measures over 200 gut bacteria and pathogens to assess microbiome balance. Evaluates digestive markers, inflammation levels, and gut permeability (leaky gut). Detects opportunistic bacteria, fungi, viruses, and antibiotic resistance genes for a full-spectrum gut health assessment. **4. Seamless Sample Processing:** Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for in-depth analysis using real-time PCR, ELISA, LC-MS, and GC-MS technologies for precise microbial and metabolic profiling. **Personalized Insights & Recommendations: **Your healthcare provider will receive a detailed report highlighting microbial imbalances, digestive function, and inflammation levels. Results can help guide dietary, probiotic, and lifestyle recommendations to support optimal gut health. Why Is This Important Microbial imbalances can drive symptoms like bloating, fatigue, brain fog, and inflammation, even in the absence of overt GI disease. Low microbial diversity is linked to poor immune resilience, higher risk of chronic disease, and reduced ability to adapt to stressors. Intestinal permeability allows toxins and food particles to enter the bloodstream, potentially triggering autoimmune responses and systemic inflammation. Early detection of gut inflammation helps prevent progression to more serious issues like IBD, food intolerances, or immune dysregulation. Impaired digestion and malabsorption can lead to nutrient deficiencies that impact energy, hormone balance, cognition, and skin health. A well-balanced gut microbiome supports detoxification, hormone metabolism, immune balance, and overall vitality, making it foundational to long-term wellness.

The Gut Zoomer is an advanced stool-based test that analyzes over 300 markers across the gut microbiome, digestive health, inflammation, immune response, and more. Unlike standard gut tests, it evaluates not only bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, parasites, and gut metabolites. Using cutting-edge technology like multiplex PCR, ELISA, and LC-MS, the Gut Zoomer maps imbalances in your gut ecosystem that may be driving chronic symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, food sensitivities, and more. The result is a detailed, actionable report that links gut dysfunction to systemic issues, helping practitioners and patients make precise, targeted interventions. #### Who should consider taking the Gut Zoomer test? The Gut Zoomer is ideal for individuals experiencing chronic, unexplained symptoms that may be connected to gut health, such as digestive issues, autoimmune conditions, hormonal imbalances, skin flare-ups, or cognitive concerns. It’s especially valuable for those with recurring infections, persistent bloating, IBS, IBD, or food intolerances. Additionally, it’s a powerful tool for proactive health seekers and those following functional or integrative medicine paths who want to understand their gut’s impact on overall wellness and longevity. #### What makes Gut Zoomer different from other microbiome or stool tests? Gut Zoomer sets itself apart through its unmatched depth and clinical utility. It analyzes 200+ microorganisms, includes a gut antibody panel, evaluates markers for gut hyper permeability (leaky gut), SCFA production, immune activity, bile acid metabolism, and more. It also includes 12 antibiotic resistance genes, helping clinicians design more effective management. Plus, the report is uniquely organized by clinical domain, digestion, detox, immunity, and inflammation, offering personalized insights and practitioner-ready recommendations. No other stool test currently matches this breadth of data and functional insight in one test. #### How can Gut Zoomer help identify the root cause of chronic health issues? Many chronic conditions, from fatigue and autoimmune disorders to mood imbalances and hormone disruption, can originate in the gut. Gut Zoomer uncovers the microbial and metabolic imbalances that often go undetected in conventional testing. For example, it can reveal overgrowth of pathogens like Candida glabrata, inflammation markers like S100A12 or MMP-9, or elevated beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that can increase re-circulation of toxins and hormones. By connecting symptoms to specific imbalances, it helps practitioners build root-cause protocols that target dysfunction at the source, not just the symptoms. #### How do I order the Gut Zoomer test and what should I expect? The Gut Zoomer test is available through licensed healthcare providers. Once ordered, you'll receive an at-home collection kit with detailed instructions and prepaid return shipping. After submitting your stool sample, results are typically available within 7 days. The final report includes a breakdown of microbial imbalances, gut function markers, immune activity, and clear, color-coded interpretations.

Results can help guide dietary, probiotic, and lifestyle recommendations to support optimal gut health. Microbial imbalances can drive symptoms like bloating, fatigue, brain fog, and inflammation, even in the absence of overt GI disease. Low microbial diversity is linked to poor immune resilience, higher risk of chronic disease, and reduced ability to adapt to stressors. Intestinal permeability allows toxins and food particles to enter the bloodstream, potentially triggering autoimmune responses and systemic inflammation. Early detection of gut inflammation helps prevent progression to more serious issues like IBD, food intolerances, or immune dysregulation. Impaired digestion and malabsorption can lead to nutrient deficiencies that impact energy, hormone balance, cognition, and skin health. A well-balanced gut microbiome supports detoxification, hormone metabolism, immune balance, and overall vitality, making it foundational to long-term wellness. ![Sample

{"kind": "section", "question": "FAQs for Gut Zoomer Test", "answer": "[ View all FAQs ](https://help.vibrant-wellness.com/hc/en-us/sections/10831197789851-Gut-Zoomer) #### What is the Gut Zoomer and how does it work? The Gut Zoomer is an advanced stool-based test that analyzes over 300 markers across the gut microbiome, digestive health, inflammation, immune response, and more. Unlike standard gut tests, it evaluates not only bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, parasites, and gut metabolites. Using cutting-edge technology like multiplex PCR, ELISA, and LC-MS, the Gut Zoomer maps imbalances in your gut ecosystem that may be driving chronic symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, food sensitivities, and more. The result is a detailed, actionable report that links gut dysfunction to systemic issues, helping practitioners and patients make precise, targeted interventions. #### Who should consider taking the Gut Zoomer test? The Gut Zoomer is ideal for individuals experiencing chronic, unexplained symptoms that may be connected to gut health, such as digestive issues, autoimmune conditions, hormonal imbalances, skin flare-ups, or cognitive concerns. It’s especially valuable for those with recurring infections, persistent bloating, IBS, IBD, or food intolerances. Additionally, it’s a powerful tool for proactive health seekers and those following functional or integrative medicine paths who want to understand their gut’s impact on overall wellness and longevity. #### What makes Gut Zoomer different from other microbiome or stool tests? Gut Zoomer sets itself apart through its unmatched depth and clinical utility. It analyzes 200+ microorganisms, includes a gut antibody panel, evaluates markers for gut hyper permeability (leaky gut), SCFA production, immune activity, bile acid metabolism, and more. It also includes 12 antibiotic resistance genes, helping clinicians design more effective management. Plus, the report is uniquely organized by clinical domain, digestion, detox, immunity, and inflammation, offering personalized insights and practitioner-ready recommendations. No other stool test currently matches this breadth of data and functional insight in one test. #### How can Gut Zoomer help identify the root cause of chronic health issues? Many chronic conditions, from fatigue and autoimmune disorders to mood imbalances and hormone disruption, can originate in the gut. Gut Zoomer uncovers the microbial and metabolic imbalances that often go undetected in conventional testing. For example, it can reveal overgrowth of pathogens like Candida glabrata, inflammation markers like S100A12 or MMP-9, or elevated beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that can increase re-circulation of toxins and hormones. By connecting symptoms to specific imbalances, it helps practitioners build root-cause protocols that target dysfunction at the source, not just the symptoms. #### How do I order the Gut Zoomer test and what should I expect? The Gut Zoomer test is available through licensed healthcare providers. Once ordered, you'll receive an at-home collection kit with detailed instructions and prepaid return shipping. After submitting your stool sample, results are typically available within 7 days.

{"kind": "section", "question": "What is the Gut Zoomer and how does it work?", "answer": "The Gut Zoomer is an advanced stool-based test that analyzes over 300 markers across the gut microbiome, digestive health, inflammation, immune response, and more. Unlike standard gut tests, it evaluates not only bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, parasites, and gut metabolites. Using cutting-edge technology like multiplex PCR, ELISA, and LC-MS, the Gut Zoomer maps imbalances in your gut ecosystem that may be driving chronic symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, food sensitivities, and more. The result is a detailed, actionable report that links gut dysfunction to systemic issues, helping practitioners and patients make precise, targeted interventions.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer", "doc_id": "ff2762fd653e8f51", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

{"kind": "section", "question": "How can Gut Zoomer help identify the root cause of chronic health issues?", "answer": "Many chronic conditions, from fatigue and autoimmune disorders to mood imbalances and hormone disruption, can originate in the gut. Gut Zoomer uncovers the microbial and metabolic imbalances that often go undetected in conventional testing. For example, it can reveal overgrowth of pathogens like Candida glabrata, inflammation markers like S100A12 or MMP-9, or elevated beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that can increase re-circulation of toxins and hormones. By connecting symptoms to specific imbalances, it helps practitioners build root-cause protocols that target dysfunction at the source, not just the symptoms.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer", "doc_id": "ff2762fd653e8f51", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}
