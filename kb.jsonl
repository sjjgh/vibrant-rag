The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease. Due to their non-specific symptoms, testing is crucial for detecting autoimmune diseases.1 Early identification and treatment are essential in preventing long-term damage. Vibrant Wellness provides autoimmune testing utilizing ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) and celiac panels. These panels identify various autoantibodies associated with autoimmunity.2 **Age is an important risk for autoimmunity, and many autoimmune diseases generally occur in the second half of adulthood when immune competence has declined, and thymic T cell generation has ceased. Many tolerance checkpoints must fail for an autoimmune disease to develop, and several of these checkpoints are susceptible to the immune aging process. 3 Some patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated immunosenescence, changes in the immune system associated with age which affects their longevity.4** ## Autoimmune diseases and longevity ## Clinical Consultants #### Dr. Matteo Colina Dr. Matteo Colina, MD, Ph.D. is a researcher who belongs to the Rheumatology Section of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of Ferrara in Italy.

Early detection of these markers helps prevent long-term complications like heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. Autoimmune diseases can significantly impact cardiovascular health by contributing to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The Autoimmune Zoomer provides crucial insights into autoimmune conditions, which can exacerbate heart disease by promoting chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Key Insights CardiaX identifies cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid levels, inflammation markers (like hs-CRP), and genetic predispositions, giving healthcare providers a full picture of heart health. It allows for early intervention to reduce the risk of chronic heart disease. By identifying autoimmune markers such as autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines, the Autoimmune Zoomer helps uncover underlying immune dysfunction that can accelerate heart disease. This test provides essential data for integrating autoimmune disease management into cardiovascular care. What’s Measured CardiaX measures lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides), C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and genetic markers that assess cardiovascular health and inflammation. The Autoimmune Zoomer measures a broad range of autoantibodies, including those for thyroid, insulin, and myelin, helping to pinpoint autoimmune activity that may affect heart health. ...", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/cardiovascular/cardia-x", "doc_id": "6e7085305b1167b3", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day. #### Why are hormone metabolism markers important? Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns. #### Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working? Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.” #### Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks? Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption. #### Will the report include treatment suggestions? Yes. Every report includes clinical context, visual trend graphs, metabolic ratios, and built-in supplement recommendations based on the patient's hormone profile, making it easy to create a targeted, personalized care plan.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/hormones/urinary-hormones-panel", "doc_id": "7fe183748fbc5f5b", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

The Food Sensitivity Profile 1 provides a broader view by testing for immune responses to 96 common foods, including wheat, gluten, and dairy. This helps individuals identify additional food triggers that may contribute to similar symptoms as wheat sensitivity. Key Insights Provides clear insights into wheat sensitivity, identifying IgG and IgA responses to gluten and other wheat proteins, helping individuals determine if wheat is the cause of chronic symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and joint pain. Measures IgG and IgA-mediated immune responses to a wide variety of foods, helping individuals pinpoint multiple food sensitivities that could be contributing to chronic symptoms like digestive distress and fatigue. What’s Measured Measures immune responses to both gluten and non-gluten wheat proteins, including markers for gliadin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and glutenin. Measures IgG and IgA immune responses to common foods such as wheat, dairy, eggs, and gluten, helping to uncover potential overlapping sensitivities and refine dietary strategies. ![Wheat Zoomer 01](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tests/Wheat-Zoomer/Wheat%20Zoomer%2001.png?width=1200&height=900&name=Wheat%20Zoomer%2001.png) Wheat Zoomer Why It Matters The Wheat Zoomer tests for immune re ...", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/food-reaction/wheat-zoomer", "doc_id": "d08a871fc9c165b8", "section": null, "source_format": "md_section"}

The test evaluates immune responses to gluten, non-gluten wheat proteins, and markers of gut permeability to assess wheat-related sensitivities and digestive health. #### How do I prepare for this test? No special preparation is needed. Patients should maintain their regular diet before testing to ensure accurate immune response measurements. #### Can this test diagnose celiac disease? While this test detects immune reactivity to gluten, a formal diagnosis of celiac disease may require additional genetic and biopsy testing. #### What symptoms suggest I need this test? Symptoms such as digestive distress, joint pain, brain fog, fatigue, and skin conditions may indicate wheat or gluten sensitivity. #### What should I do if my results show a sensitivity to wheat?
