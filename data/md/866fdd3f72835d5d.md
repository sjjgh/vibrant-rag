##  Test for Gut Health
Your gut microbiome plays a critical role in optimal digestion, nutrient metabolism, your energy, how your body detoxes harmful chemicals and toxins, maintenance of structural integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, healthy skin and protecting you from infection.1,2

**Vibrantâ€™s Gut Zoomer Test assesses a wide range of gut micro-organisms, gut metabolites, and relevant digestive and inflammatory markers which will give insights into your gut health.**
The Gut microbiome participates in GI processes as well as immune, metabolic, and neurological functions.3 Owing to its key effects on various bodily processes, a change in the gut microbiome can modify the hostâ€™s disease risks. There appears to be a reciprocal relationship with age, wherein the gut microbiome changes as one ages, and modulation in itself can also lead to aging.3 A shift or dysbiosis in the gut microbiome can lead to local and systemic inflammation, which results in accelerated aging.4

##  Expert opinions
![jens-walter-circle](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/jens-walter-circle.png?width=2500&height=2475&name=jens-walter-circle.png)
####  Dr. Jens Walter
Dr. Jens Walter, Ph.D. is the CAIP chair for nutrition, microbes, and gastrointestinal health at the University of Alberta, Canada. His research primarily focuses on the microbial ecology of the human and animal gastrointestinal tract and the metabolic and immunological interactions between the microbiome and its host in relation to health. He perceives the relationship between the gut microbiome and their host to be symbiont. He is interested to understand how environmental factors (such as diet and lifestyle) and historic processes impact the gut microbiome and the host at large. Dr. Walter's interdisciplinary and highly collaborative studies have proven that the gut microbiome has a profound effect on the host's health.5
![Susan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Susan.png?width=303&height=304&name=Susan.png)
####  Dr. Susan Lynch
Dr. Susan Lynch, Ph.D. is a professor in the Department of Medicine â€“ Gastroenterology, at the University of California, San Francisco, USA. Her work primarily focuses on the gastrointestinal microbiome, and its role in both the origins of and established chronic inflammatory diseases. She believes that bioactive products of the gut microbiome influence host cellular populations in a co-evolved, and frequently reciprocal relationship. As a result, perturbation to the composition and function of the gut microbiome leads to the development of chronic diseases. She relentlessly strives to determine the microbial-derived mechanisms that promote immune function and contribute to the origins of childhood asthma and inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease, as she believes that manipulating the gut microbiome can help prevent and manage chronic inflammatory conditions6.

##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Antibody Profiling and Prevalence in the US population during the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic
In the book chapter, â€˜The Gut Microbiomeâ€™, we have put together our thoughts on the intestinal microbiota, their effect on human health and disease, technological advances in assessing the gut microbiome, and dietary and supplemental probiotics, prebiotics, and phenolic compounds that help in addressing intestinal dysbiosis7.
####  Serology profile and effects of influenza vaccination on COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patientsâ€™
In our publication, â€˜Evaluation of the Vibrant DNA microarray for the high-throughput multiplex detection of enteric pathogens in clinical samplesâ€™, we report the effectiveness of the high-throughput Vibrant GI pathogen panel in providing an etiologic diagnosis of GI infections in the laboratory setting.8
