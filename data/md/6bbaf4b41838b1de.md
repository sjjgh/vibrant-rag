The Organic Acids Test measures key metabolic markers, providing insights into mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and nutrient deficiencies that can affect energy production, detoxification, and overall health.
The Micronutrient Panel complements the Organic Acids Test by identifying nutrient deficiencies that can affect organic acid metabolism. It assesses levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants essential for optimal metabolic function.
Key Insights
Helps identify imbalances in critical metabolic pathways, such as those linked to neurotransmitter production, mitochondrial health, and gut dysbiosis, enabling early detection of potential metabolic dysfunctions.
Identifies deficiencies in essential nutrients like B-vitamins, magnesium, and antioxidants, which are necessary for proper detoxification and mitochondrial function. This helps address the root causes of imbalances identified in the Organic Acids Test.
What’s Measured
Measures a wide range of organic acids related to mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut health, providing a clearer understanding of metabolic and nutritional health.
Measures over 30 essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to ensure the body has the nutrients needed to support mitochondrial health, detoxification, and optimal metabolic function.
