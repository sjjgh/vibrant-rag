##  Test for Neural Health
The nervous system is responsible for controlling and coordinating bodily functions such as movement, sensation, cognition, and emotion, meaning that any damage or dysfunction to the nervous system can significantly impact a person's health and daily activities. Preserving optimal neural health is crucial in preventing cognitive decline and reducing the likelihood of neurodegenerative diseases.1
Neural health testing enables early detection of potential neural health issues, monitoring over time, and personalized interventions, making it essential for maintaining good neural health.
**Vibrant Wellness provides the Neural Zoomer Plus Test, which evaluates reactivity to neurological antigens associated with various neurologically related diseases.**
**Neural health gradually deteriorates with age, resulting in structural and neurophysiological alterations as well as a reduction in cognitive ability. 3 During aging, the neural cellular environment exhibits evidence of compromised bioenergetics, impaired adaptive neuroplasticity, and a vulnerability to excessive neural activity. This results in the accumulation of damaged neural molecules and organelles, inflammation, and a loss of cognitive abilities, all of which have been shown to affect longevity.3,4**

![Stojan](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Stojan.png?width=398&height=383&name=Stojan.png)
####  Dr. Stojan Peric
Dr. Stojan Peric, MD, Ph.D. is a teaching assistant and neurologist at the Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Center of Serbia. His research interests include various aspects of clinical neurology, including movement disorders, neuromuscular diseases, neuroimmunology, and neuro-ophthalmology. Dr. Peric investigated the functional and morphological impairments of the central nervous system in patients with myotonic dystrophy type1. Dr. Stojan Peric's mission is to advance the field of neurology through rigorous research that examines both the clinical and basic aspects of neuromuscular diseases. His research seeks to deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that contribute to neurological diseases and identify potential therapeutic targets for their treatment.5
##  Expert opinions
![Marilyn](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Marilyn.webp?width=376&height=299&name=Marilyn.webp)
####  Dr. Marilyn Albert
Dr. Marilyn Albert, Ph.D. is a professor of Neurology at Johns Hopkins, and Director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience, USA. Dr. Albert focuses on the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). She has also identified lifestyle factors that promote the maintenance of mental abilities with advancing age. In one of her papers, she mentions that the changes in cognition are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD. Understanding the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging might provide information to improve early diagnosis. Dr. Albert believes that focusing on the early identification of AD, and potential ways of monitoring the progression of the disease is needed for its early intervention.6

####  Dr. Vikram Khurana
Dr. Vikram Khurana, Ph.D. is the Chief of the Division of Movement Disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School and Principal Faculty at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, USA. His clinical and research interests relate to neurodegenerative movement disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease. Dr. Khurana and colleagues have advanced the understanding of cellular consequences of alpha-synuclein (a protein involved in Parkinson's pathology) misfolding, the fundamental pathology associated with Parkinson's and related diseases. He believes that this understanding is essential to developing treatments that target alpha-synuclein.7
