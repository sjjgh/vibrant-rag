The Oxidative Stress Profile is a urine and saliva test that evaluates oxidative damage, antioxidant capacity, and cellular resilience, key factors in understanding the biological rate of aging and foundational elements of longevity. Using advanced liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the test measures 16 urinary markers of oxidative damage to DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. It also analyzes 32 antioxidant-related genetic variants via RT-PCR to assess your inherited capacity to neutralize free radicals. This test provides clinical insight into free radical activity, inflammation, and mitochondrial function, helping guide targeted strategies to reduce oxidative stress and support long-term cellular health.

Mycotoxins Test
[](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/toxins/mycotoxins)
Why It Matters
The Oxidative Stress Profile measures key markers of oxidative damage and antioxidant levels in the body. Oxidative stress is a major contributor to aging, chronic inflammation, and the development of diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders.
The Mycotoxins Test complements the Oxidative Stress Profile by identifying exposure to mold toxins that contribute to oxidative stress and immune dysfunction. Mycotoxins are toxic substances produced by mold that can damage cells and exacerbate chronic health conditions.
Key Insights
Identifies oxidative damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, helping to assess the body's ability to fight free radicals and support mitochondrial health. This test provides actionable data to address oxidative stress through targeted interventions.
Identifies specific mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins and ochratoxins, that contribute to oxidative stress, helping to understand the root cause of chronic inflammation and immune suppression in the body.
What’s Measured
Measures markers of oxidative damage, including markers for mitochondrial dysfunction and antioxidant capacity, providing a clear understanding of the body’s oxidative burden.
Measures mycotoxins, including aflatoxins, ochratoxins, and trichothecenes, providing insight into toxin accumulation and its role in oxidative damage.
