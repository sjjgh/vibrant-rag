##  Test for Toxins
Humans are exposed to a wide array of toxins from the environment and common household products. Environmental toxins or toxicants are man-made or naturally occurring substances that can cause acute or chronic toxic overload when absorbed, inhaled, or ingested. For example, heavy metals, pesticides, petroleum by-products, and other chemicals. High exposure to toxins can have detrimental effects as it can affect multiple body systems.1

**Vibrant Toxic Exposures testing detects various toxins and can reveal the root cause of chronic inflammatory symptoms and disease.**
**Aging is associated with a decline in the ability to mount robust responses to toxins, making one more susceptible to toxic burden. 2 Prolonged exposure to Environmental toxins and Mycotoxins leads to the risk of DNA damage and affects genomic stability.3,4 Heavy metals can interfere with protein folding and can induce protein denaturation, thereby affecting proteomic stability.5 As a result, exposure to toxins can affect molecular function which may be detrimental to biological aging.6,7 **

####  Prof. Renald Blundell
Chev. Prof. Renald Blundell, Ph.D. is an associate professor in the department of Physiology & Biochemistry and Faculty of Medicine & Surgery at the University of Malta, Malta. Chev. Prof. Blundell has on several publications about toxins and their effects in various body systems. Continued exposure to toxins can have adverse effects and understanding how toxins affect the human body and pave way to a myriad of other disorders can help to reduce exposure and take appropriate measures to reduce its impact. Chev. Prof. Blundell's work on toxins can help in understanding this.8

####  Dr. Roberto Lucchini
Dr. Roberto Lucchini, MD, is a professor at the School of Public Health, Florida International University, USA. His research is mainly focused on Effects of neurotoxic chemicals and the biochemical mechanisms by which environmental toxins can damage the nervous system from neurodevelopment to neurodegeneration. Dr. Lucchini and his team has worked on effects of toxins on the nervous system in age groups ranging from early childhood to old age. His work also extends to understanding the role of environmental toxins in aging. He is also involved in understanding the health effect among workers and responders who were exposed to chemicals and intense psychological trauma at the World Trade Center after the 9/11 terrorist attack.9

####  Dr. Alan M. Ducatman
Dr. Alan Ducatman, MD. MSc. is a member of the West Virginia Governor’s Advisory Council on Substance Abuse in the USA. His research is mainly focused on environmental health. Some of his research interests are the health outcomes after exposure to environmental toxins, exposure to environmental perfluorocarbon and the human physiologic responses, using secondary data to understand environmental health questions, etc.11 He has stressed the importance of reviewing and improving the medical guidelines for toxins exposure (e.g., PFAS) and has published several papers.

####  Dr. Suzanne E. Fenton
Dr. Suzanne E. Fenton, Ph.D. is a staff scientist of National Toxicology Program, which is a part of National Institute of Environmental Sciences, North Carolina, USA. She has worked on and published several studies on per and poly-fluoroalkyl substances or PFAS. PFAS is highly toxic and can adversely affect human health. She believes that PFAS can have detrimental effects on human health and has worked to understand these effects on different body systems10.
