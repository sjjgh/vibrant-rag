##  Test for Hormones
Hormones are molecules produced by the endocrine system and regulates functions like growth and development, reproduction, metabolism, and electrolyte balance. Hormones are synthesized by the endocrine glands into the bloodstream.1 Hormonal imbalance can affect metabolism resulting in weight gain, fatigue, slow heartbeat. It can also accelerate aging.
Vibrant America has Hormones Panel which helps determine the status of reproductive, metabolic, and steroid hormones and metabolites and uncover hormonal imbalances and hormone-related diseases.
**The endocrine system and hormones maintain and regulate several factors like metabolism, reproduction, response to stress, growth, etc. Hence, hormones play a key role in longevity and aging. 2 Reproductive hormones like androgens and estrogens and thyroid hormones can influence longevity. Decrease in the hormones with age changes metabolism, cellular interactions, and growth which can accelerate aging.3**
##  Hormones and Longevity
##  Clinical Consultants
####  Dr. James Roney
James Roney, Ph.D. is a professor in the department of Phycology and brain Sciences at the University of California, USA. His research focuses on human endocrinology and how hormones produce coordinated output effects that are adaptive responses to specific input conditions. Dr. Roney has worked on how reactive hormone increases during encounters with potential mates and how women’s motivational priorities changes can be predicted according to the shift in ovarian hormones across menstrual cycle.4

####  Dr. Liou Y. Sun
Dr. Liou Y. Sun, MD, Ph.D. is an associate professor in the Department of Biology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, USA. His research is focused on how nutrition and hormones during early development can influence long-term health and age-related diseases. Hormones play a role in aging and understanding this mechanism can help to improve longevity and reduce the development of age-related disorders. Dr. Sun is also studying interventions for age-related disorders 5.

####  Dr. Andrzej Bartke
Dr. Andrzej Bartke, Ph.D. is a professor of internal medicine and physiology at the Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine in Springfield, USA. His research is mainly focused on genetic and hormonal control of aging in mammals. He has published several papers on hormonal control of aging and longevity. Hormones heavily influence aging and hormonal imbalance can lead to age-related disorders. Hence, his work on hormonal control of aging is extremely important. He is currently working on growth hormone and its effects on aging and longevity.6

##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism
In our study ‘Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism’ we have explained in detail the pathology of thyroid imbalance in the context of human reproductive health, autoimmunity, and micronutrient imbalance..7
####  Human Reproductive Health in Relation to Thyroid Alterations
In the study ‘Human Reproductive Health in Relation to Thyroid Alterations’ we showed that different thyroid alterations have different effects on the reproductive health of men and women. Based on this study, we encourage individuals to frequently test for reproductive and related hormones as individuals can be susceptible to thyroid disease.8
####  Significance of anti-TPO as an early predictive marker in thyroid disease
In the study ‘Significance of anti-TPO as an early predictive marker in thyroid disease’ we showed that anti-TPO levels were high prior to the onset of thyroid hormone dysfunction. Hence, testing for anti-TPO along with TSH can help in identifying high-risk individuals and help to reduce long-term morbidity.9
####  Effect of micronutrients on thyroid parameters
In the study ‘Effect of micronutrients on thyroid parameters’ we observed that the deficiency in essential micronutrients results in extreme derangement in thyroid functioning. Serum levels of amino acids like asparagine, serine, valine, leucine, and arginine are related to thyroid functioning.10
