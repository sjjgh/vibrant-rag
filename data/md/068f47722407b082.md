##  Test for Food Reactions
Food allergies, additives, and sensitivities are reactions that occur on ingestion of certain provocative food nutrients or additives. These reactions are mainly intestinal but can also occur in extra-intestinal parts of the body.1 Food-mediated reactions contribute to a leaky gut leading to chronic inflammation and disease development. The symptoms associated may include abdominal pain, hives, bloating, bowel irregularity, brain fog, headache, fatigue, muscle, and joint pain.2,3
**Uncover allergies, sensitivities, and autoimmunity to commonly consumed foods in the Western diet with Vibrant Food Reactions panels.**
**Advancing age is associated with:**
**increased inflammatory cytokines, a decline in the gut barrier function, and poor adaptive immunity. 4**
**This increases the susceptibility to exacerbated inflammatory reactions to foods. Chronic inflammation caused by food reactions can be life-threatening and can increase the risk of a shorter lifespan. 4,5**

####  Arturo Borzutzky, MD
Arturo Borzutzky, MD, is a pediatric rheumatology specialist and is currently an Assistant Professor of Allergy, Immunology, and Pediatric Rheumatology at the School of Medicine, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Santiago, Chile. His research mainly focuses on the pathogenesis and treatment of atopic dermatitis, epidemiology of allergic diseases, Kawasaki disease, and pediatric autoimmunity. Dr. Borzutzky also actively studies the prevalence and manifestations of food allergies. He believes that the increased occurrence of food allergies may be due to changes in lifestyle.6

####  Prof. Halina Kazimiera Grajeta
Professor Halina Kazimiera Grajeta, Ph.D. is a part of the Department of Dietetics and Food Science at Wroclaw Medical University, Poland. She has actively worked on understanding the effects of diet on human health. In one of her papers, she mentions that the identification of the food additives responsible for hypersensitivity and their treatment is challenging. However, effective diagnosis of the reaction-inducing additives can enable restricting or eliminating the food additive from one’s diet. This can help avoid food additive-mediated reactions and discomforts associated with them.8

####  Dr. Joseph Murray
Dr. Joseph Murray, MD, is currently a Professor of Medicine, at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, and a clinician investigator and consultant in the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology and Department of Immunology. He is also an Adjunct Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Southern Denmark. Dr. Murray has conducted extensive research on the clinical epidemiology of the celiac disease, the role of genetics in predicting disease, and the development of animal models for the disease and its associated dermatologic condition, and dermatitis herpetiformis. Many of his research programs have been sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He led the first clinical trials of novel methods for treating celiac disease. He has published more than 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers, chapters, and books on celiac disease and esophageal reflux.7

####  Dr. Ruchi Gupta
Ruchi Gupta, MD, MPH, is a Professor of Pediatrics and Medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and a Clinical Attending at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. She is well known for her groundbreaking research in the field of food allergy. In her book, Food without Fear, she states that one in five people in the U.S. suffer from food allergies, sensitivities, or intolerances. She sheds light on the differences between an allergy and an intolerance/sensitivity and focuses on the need for effective diagnosis. She also discusses the microbiome's role in adverse food reactions. Dr. Ruchi believes that effective testing for food allergies and sensitivities would help manage these conditions appropriately, thereby improving the individual's quality of life.9

##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Effect of Personalized Elimination Diet on Food Sensitivity Related Symptoms
In our clinical trial, ‘Effect of Personalized Elimination Diet on Food Sensitivity Related Symptoms’, we are using our microarray technology to identify food sensitivities in patients presenting with gastrointestinal discomfort. We ultimately aim to establish a biomarker panel for the differential diagnosis of food sensitivity-related diseases.
####  Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease
In our publication, ‘Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease’, we reported the identification of immunogenic epitopes of the tissue transglutaminase- deamidated gliadin peptide complex which could aid in the detection and monitoring of celiac patients.10
####  Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays
In our study, ‘Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays’, we employed our high-density peptide microarray technique to establish novel sets of epitopes from gliadin which showed a high degree of accuracy in differentiating Celiac Disease patients from controls.11
####  Overlap of Characteristic Serological Antibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Wheat-Related Disorders
In the study, ‘Overlap of Characteristic Serological Antibodies in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Wheat-Related Disorders’, we used our Wheat Zoomer antibody panel to assess the presence of wheat protein antibodies in Rheumatoid arthritis seropositive subjects.
####  Peptide microarrays and novel biomarkers for celiac disease
Our patent, ‘Peptide microarrays and novel biomarkers for celiac disease’ relates generally to biomarkers and peptide arrays, and, more particularly, to a method of using a peptide array to identify biomarkers for an autoimmune disease such as celiac disease.
####  High Frequency of Extractable Nuclear Autoantibodies in Wheat-Related Disorders
In our study, ‘High Frequency of Extractable Nuclear Autoantibodies in Wheat-Related Disorders,’ we used our Wheat Zoomer Antigen Panel to explore the presence of autoimmunity among wheat-sensitive individuals.13
####  Insights into cardiovascular risk and nutritional status in subjects with wheat-related disorders
In the study, ‘Insights into cardiovascular risk and nutritional status in subjects with wheat-related disorders’, we used our Wheat Zoomer Antigen Panel and found that subjects with positive serology for the Wheat Zoomer test had altered blood lipid profiles.13
