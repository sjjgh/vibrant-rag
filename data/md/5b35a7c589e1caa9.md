Key Insights
Provides insights into how lectins affect digestive health and immune function, helping individuals identify specific foods that may be exacerbating gut inflammation, autoimmune responses, and other systemic symptoms.
Tests for microbial imbalances, digestive dysfunction, and pathogens in the gut, providing deeper insights into the gut environment and its connection to lectin-related sensitivities. Helps identify if gut health is exacerbating lectin sensitivities.
What’s Measured
Measures IgG and IgA immune responses to lectins found in various foods, such as beans, grains, and vegetables, providing clarity on how these proteins impact health.
Measures gut microbiome imbalances, including bacteria, fungi, and pathogens, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how gut health impacts lectin sensitivities.
