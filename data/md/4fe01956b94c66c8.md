[ ![Food Sensitivity Test](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Test%20Pages/Candida%20and%20+%20IBS%20Profile/1%20\(1\).webp?width=1374&height=1030&name=1%20\(1\).webp) Food Sensitivity Complete The Food Sensitivity Complete evaluates immune responses to a broad range of foods, including potential nutrient depletions caused by food sensitivities. It helps identify other food triggers that may exacerbate symptoms, such as fatigue, digestive discomfort, and immune dysfunction. ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/food-reaction/food-sensitivity-complete)
[ ![Micronutrients Panel](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Test%20Pages/Candida%20and%20+%20IBS%20Profile/1%20\(3\).webp?width=869&height=878&name=1%20\(3\).webp) Micronutrient Panel The Micronutrient Panel assesses nutrient levels that are critical for optimal methylation, immune function, and overall health. It complements the NutriPro by providing data on nutrient status and how genetic variations affect nutrient absorption. ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/nutrients/micronutrient-panel)
[ ![Organic Acids Test](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/HD%20Assets/Test%20Pages/Candida%20and%20+%20IBS%20Profile/1.png?width=1200&height=900&name=1.png) Organic Acids Test The Organic Acids Test evaluates key metabolic markers related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and nutrient metabolism. It complements the NutriPro by providing insights into how genetic variations in nutrient metabolism affect energy production and detoxification. ](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/nutrients/organic-acids)
[ ![Gut Zoomer-Icon](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tests/Gut-Zoomer/Gut%20Zoomer-Icon.png?width=1200&height=900&name=Gut%20Zoomer-Icon.png) Gut Zoomer The Gut Zoomer analyzes the gut microbiome and its role in nutrient absorption. Microbial imbalances can impact nutrient utilization, making this test a valuable complement to the NutriPro for optimizing nutrient intake. ](https://22446299.hs-sites.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer?__hstc=84994950.fb8042829f76cc82cc0a855c32a6d4c3.1758156478080.1758156478080.1758156478080.1&__hssc=84994950.1.1758156478080&__hsfp=784725215)
