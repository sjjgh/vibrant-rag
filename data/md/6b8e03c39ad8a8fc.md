####  What does the Viral Infections panel test for?
The panel evaluates IgG and IgM antibodies to six viruses and one bacterium to identify active or past infections.
####  Do I need to prepare for the test?
No special preparation is required. Patients can follow their regular routine unless otherwise directed by their provider.
####  What are the long-term risks of untreated viral infections?
Untreated viral infections can lead to chronic inflammation, autoimmune conditions, persistent fatigue, and neurological dysfunction. Early detection helps mitigate these risks through targeted care.
####  Can this test differentiate between active and past infections?
Yes, the test distinguishes between active (IgM antibodies) and past (IgG antibodies) infections, providing comprehensive insights into immune responses.
