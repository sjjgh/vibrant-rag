**1. Simple Testing Process:**
Follow our step-by-step instructions to complete this urine test at home.
**2. Pre-Test Guidelines:**
No fasting required, but fasting for 12 hours before testing may increase mycotoxin excretion in urine.
Hydration Considerations: Do not drink more than 8 oz of water one hour before urine collection to prevent overly diluted samples, which may be rejected.
Dietary Considerations: No specific dietary restrictions before testing.
Provoked vs. Unprovoked Testing: Your provider may recommend taking a "provoking agent" (such as NAC, DMSA, or EDTA) before testing to promote the release of mycotoxins.
Medication & Supplement Considerations: Consult with your provider regarding whether to continue or discontinue any dietary supplements or medications before your test.
**3. Best Collection Practices:**
Collect your first-morning urine sample upon awakening, before eating or drinking.
Do not collect urine if you wake up and urinate overnight.
Ensure the sample is properly sealed and stored according to the provided instructions.
**4. Seamless Sample Processing:**
Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for comprehensive analysis, and work with your healthcare provider to interpret your results and develop a personalized detoxification and health optimization plan.
