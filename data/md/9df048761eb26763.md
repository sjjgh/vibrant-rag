####  Comprehensive UTI Pathogen Detection
The UTI Zoomer tests for a wide variety of pathogens, including bacterial, fungal, and viral agents associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs). This test goes beyond traditional UTI testing by providing a broader analysis of potential pathogens and their antibiotic resistance patterns.
####  Catch UTIs Early & Accurately
Urinary tract infections can be tricky to diagnose, especially when symptoms are unclear or recurrent. The UTI Zoomer helps detect infections early, even those caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms, allowing for quicker treatment and reducing the likelihood of chronic UTIs.
####  Take Control of Your Urinary Health
UTIs can cause significant discomfort and complications if not properly managed. The UTI Zoomer provides actionable results to help you understand your specific infection and guide your healthcare provider in choosing the right treatment options to optimize your urinary health.
####  A Personalized UTI Treatment Plan
Based on detailed data about the pathogen involved and its antibiotic resistance, your healthcare provider can create a personalized treatment plan to address your specific UTI infection, improve recovery time, and reduce the likelihood of recurrence.
##  The UTI Zoomer provides a complete assessment of the urinary system
Detects a broad spectrum of UTI-causing pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes while evaluating key urinalysis markers. This test helps identify potential infections early and supports targeted treatment strategies to improve urinary and overall health outcomes.

Gut Zoomer
[](https://22446299.hs-sites.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer)
Why It Matters
The UTI Zoomer tests for a broad range of urinary pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses, providing a comprehensive view of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and their impact on urinary health.
The Gut Zoomer complements the UTI Zoomer by offering a comprehensive evaluation of the gut microbiome, which plays a crucial role in immune function and can influence urinary tract health. Imbalances in the gut microbiome can contribute to UTI frequency and severity.
