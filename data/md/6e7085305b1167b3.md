##  Pair CardiaX with Autoimmune Zoomer Testing
![Cardio Health Icon](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Tests/Cardiac-Health-Panel/Images/Cardio%20Health%20Icon.png?width=1379&height=1601&name=Cardio%20Health%20Icon.png)

Autoimmune Zoomer
[](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/autoimmune/autoimmune-zoomer)
Why It Matters
CardiaX provides a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health, identifying biomarkers associated with heart disease, inflammation, and overall heart function. Early detection of these markers helps prevent long-term complications like heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure.
Autoimmune diseases can significantly impact cardiovascular health by contributing to inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The Autoimmune Zoomer provides crucial insights into autoimmune conditions, which can exacerbate heart disease by promoting chronic inflammation and immune dysregulation.
Key Insights
CardiaX identifies cardiovascular risk factors, including lipid levels, inflammation markers (like hs-CRP), and genetic predispositions, giving healthcare providers a full picture of heart health. It allows for early intervention to reduce the risk of chronic heart disease.
By identifying autoimmune markers such as autoantibodies and inflammatory cytokines, the Autoimmune Zoomer helps uncover underlying immune dysfunction that can accelerate heart disease. This test provides essential data for integrating autoimmune disease management into cardiovascular care.
What’s Measured
CardiaX measures lipid profiles (cholesterol, triglycerides), C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and genetic markers that assess cardiovascular health and inflammation.
The Autoimmune Zoomer measures a broad range of autoantibodies, including those for thyroid, insulin, and myelin, helping to pinpoint autoimmune activity that may affect heart health.

####  What does the CardiaX test evaluate?
The CardiaX test evaluates genetic variants (SNPs) linked to cardiovascular conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
####  Do I need to prepare for the test?
No special preparation is required. Patients can provide either a saliva sample or a blood draw following straightforward collection instructions provided by their healthcare provider.
####  How does this test support heart health?
By identifying genetic predispositions, the CardiaX panel empowers patients and providers to develop personalized care strategies, addressing risk factors through tailored interventions.
####  How long does it take to receive results?
Results are typically available within 7–10 business days, securely shared with your healthcare provider to guide informed decision-making.
####  Can this test predict heart disease?
While the CardiaX panel identifies genetic risk factors, it is not a diagnostic tool. Results should be interpreted alongside clinical evaluations and other diagnostic tests to provide a comprehensive understanding of heart health.
