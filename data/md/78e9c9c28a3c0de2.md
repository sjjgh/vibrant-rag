####  What does the Peanut Zoomer Test measure?
This test evaluates immune reactivity to 17 peanut peptides, distinguishing between peanut sensitivity and allergy risk.
####  Do I need to fast before taking this test?
No fasting is required. Patients should follow their normal diet before testing.
####  Can this test diagnose a peanut allergy?
While this test provides insight into peanut sensitivity and immune reactivity, a formal peanut allergy diagnosis may require additional IgE testing.
####  What symptoms suggest I need this test?
Symptoms such as digestive distress, skin irritation, brain fog, and respiratory issues may indicate peanut sensitivity.
####  How do I use my results to improve my health?
Your provider will guide you on dietary modifications, lifestyle adjustments, and supplement strategies based on your immune reactivity results.
