####  Healthspan Assessment Panel
Assesses key markers of cardiovascular (heart & blood vessels), endocrine (hormone), hepatic (liver), renal (kidney), immune, and metabolic health, along with markers of inflammation, autoimmunity, and nutrient status.

####  Oxidative Stress Profile
The Oxidative Stress Profile measures 32 common SNPs and 16 markers of oxidative damage to assess your genetic ability to manage oxidative stress, as well as your current stress status.

##  Test for Longevity
Research shows oxidative stress speeds up aging1 and triggers diseases like heart issues, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and inflammation. This stress damages DNA, messes with proteins, and disrupts cell signals.
Our longevity support tests measure genetic variations and key markers of oxidative damage, cardiac health, inflammation, autoimmunity, nutrient status, and more to position you for optimal health and longevity.
**Cellular degeneration and aging is a natural process influenced by various biological, genetic, environmental, and social factors. However, in the modern world, with daily exposure to oxidative stress and inflammatory triggers, including environmental toxins, processed foods, and stress, accelerated aging has become a prominent concern. While the average human life span has greatly increased in recent decades, this improvement has not been similarly reflected in health span. 2 Accelerated aging is directly linked to age-related diseases like neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, immune system disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders, inhibiting longevity.2 **

####  Dr. Marilyn Albert
Dr. Marilyn Albert, Ph.D. is a professor of Neurology at Johns Hopkins, and Director of the Division of Cognitive Neuroscience, USA. Dr. Albert focuses on the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). She has also identified lifestyle factors that promote the maintenance of mental abilities with advancing age. In one of her papers, she mentions that the changes in cognition are associated with aging and with neurodegenerative disorders, particularly AD. Understanding the cognitive and brain changes associated with aging might provide information to improve early diagnosis. Dr. Albert believes that focusing on the early identification of AD, and potential ways of monitoring the progression of the disease is needed for its early intervention.6

####  Dr. Bruce Ames
Dr. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., has pioneered the fields of biochemistry and nutritional science. He is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the University of California, Berkeley, and most recently was a Senior Scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), and director of their Nutrition & Metabolism Center, USA. According to Dr. Ames, micronutrient deficiencies may result in chronic metabolic disruption, DNA damage, and mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging. These factors may lead to serious health conditions. Dr. Ames proposed the triage theory, which states that the body has developed a rationing response to shortages of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) throughout evolution. In nutrient deficiency states, the scarce micronutrient in the cells is allotted to proteins essential for short-term survival. Proteins needed for long-term health, including those that protect DNA, lose out and become disabled and which leads to diseases of aging. He believes that micronutrient supplementation is the way to ensure intake of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of micronutrients.5

####  Oxidative Stress: Mechanisms, Quantification and Its Role in Human Aging
In this review, “Oxidative Stress: Mechanisms, Quantification and Its Role in Human Aging”, we discuss how key oxidant species are generated, their sources, the beneficial roles they play at low levels, and the damage they exert at elevated levels, as well as measurement techniques for oxidative damage and key exogenous and endogenous antioxidant markers.
####  Association of APOE Polymorphisms with Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers
In our study, “Association of APOE Polymorphisms with Serological Lipid and Inflammatory Markers”, we found strong evidence linking APOE gene polymorphisms to abnormal serum lipid and inflammatory profiles that can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and Alzheimer’s disease.
