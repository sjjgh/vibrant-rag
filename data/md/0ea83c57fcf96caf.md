##  Test for Autoimmune
Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues, causing long-term damage to organs and tissues. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, and Graves' disease. Due to their non-specific symptoms, testing is crucial for detecting autoimmune diseases.1
Early identification and treatment are essential in preventing long-term damage. Vibrant Wellness provides autoimmune testing utilizing ANA (anti-nuclear antibody), ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) and celiac panels. These panels identify various autoantibodies associated with autoimmunity.2
**Age is an important risk for autoimmunity, and many autoimmune diseases generally occur in the second half of adulthood when immune competence has declined, and thymic T cell generation has ceased. Many tolerance checkpoints must fail for an autoimmune disease to develop, and several of these checkpoints are susceptible to the immune aging process. 3 Some patients with autoimmune diseases have accelerated immunosenescence, changes in the immune system associated with age which affects their longevity.4**

####  Dr. Matteo Colina
Dr. Matteo Colina, MD, Ph.D. is a researcher who belongs to the Rheumatology Section of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine at the University of Ferrara in Italy. Dr. Matteo Colina's research primarily focuses on rheumatology. He has contributed to several studies related to bone and joint diseases such as osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. One of his recent studies examined the impact of moderate physical activity on bone mineral density in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, finding that exercise can be crucial in managing the condition. In another study, Dr. Matteo Colina and his team assessed the effectiveness and safety of a new treatment for osteoarthritis and observed that it significantly alleviated pain and improved joint function in patients. Dr. Matteo Colina believes that the advancement of our understanding of bone and joint diseases has the potential to lead to the development of new and improved treatment options for these conditions.6

####  Dr. Donna Bunch
Dr. Donna Bunch, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Bunch's research focuses on understanding how autoimmune diseases affect the kidney, and how abnormal B cell responses lead to the development of microparticles and cytokines that cause disease. She is particularly interested in understanding how regulatory B cells help maintain balance in the immune system and promote autoimmune disease remission. Dr. Bunch's goal is to translate our understanding of autoimmune disease pathogenesis into better clinical tools that can be used to predict relapse and better management of autoimmune diseases affecting the kidney.7

####  Dr. Meghan Free
Dr. Meghan Free, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at UNC School of Medicine, North Carolina, USA. Dr. Free’s research focuses on understanding the role of T cells in autoimmune glomerulonephritis. Her studies have shown that regulatory T cells do not function properly in patients with this disease and that this lack of regulation leads to excess inflammation alongside autoreactive T cells. She is currently examining the potential role of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in autoimmune glomerulonephritis conditions. Dr. Free believes that investigating the roles of T cells and circulating immune components would help understand their contributions to autoimmune disease progression and relapse.8

##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects
In our publication, ‘Exploring Systemic Autoimmunity in Thyroid Disease Subjects’, we explored the association between autoantibodies and thyroid disease and found strong associations between autoantibodies and thyroid hormones.9
####  Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease
In our study, ‘Synthetic Neoepitopes of the Transglutaminase–Deamidated Gliadin Complex as Biomarkers for Diagnosing and Monitoring Celiac Disease’, we found that the neoepitopes derived from the tTG-DGP complex are highly accurate predictors of untreated Celiac disease mucosa. Additionally, we found that persistent immune response to these epitopes could serve as a promising non-invasive predictor of ongoing mucosal injury in patients with treated Celiac disease.10
####  Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays
In our study, ‘Determination of B-Cell Epitopes in Patients with Celiac Disease: Peptide Microarrays’, we used a novel method of ultra-high-density peptide microarray combined with computational methods to identify discontinuous B-cell epitopes in celiac disease patients.11
####  A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity
In our study, ‘A Multiplex Autoantibody Panel for Early Detection of Autoimmune Disease Activity’, we used our multiplex ANA + ENA panel detect multiple autoantibodies simultaneously, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of autoimmune activity.12
