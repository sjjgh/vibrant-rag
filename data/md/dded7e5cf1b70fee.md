[](https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/food-reaction/wheat-zoomer)
Why It Matters
The Wheat Zoomer focuses specifically on immune reactivity to wheat proteins, making it a natural complement to the Grain Zoomer, which evaluates a broader array of grains. This test hones in on wheat-specific reactions, offering more targeted insights into how wheat impacts health.
Key Insights
By measuring immune responses to wheat-specific proteins, the Wheat Zoomer provides a clearer understanding of wheat sensitivities, which may contribute to chronic symptoms such as digestive distress, skin issues, and fatigue.
What’s Measured
Measures IgG and IgA responses to various wheat proteins, providing a detailed look at how wheat-specific immune responses contribute to inflammation and other health problems.
