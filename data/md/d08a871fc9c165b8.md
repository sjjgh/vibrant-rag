Wheat-related sensitivities can contribute to chronic digestive issues, fatigue, and skin conditions, yet many individuals remain unaware of their sensitivity to wheat proteins.
Gluten intolerance is the most well-known wheat-related sensitivity, but non-gluten components of wheat can also trigger immune responses and cause systemic inflammation.
The Wheat Zoomer tests for immune reactivity to a wide range of wheat proteins, including gluten and non-gluten components, offering a more comprehensive view of wheat sensitivities than traditional tests.
By identifying wheat sensitivities early, individuals can eliminate problem grains from their diet, reducing inflammation and improving digestive health.
Wheat-related sensitivities are often misdiagnosed or overlooked, contributing to chronic conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), autoimmune disorders, and chronic fatigue.
Eliminating wheat from the diet can lead to improved digestion, skin health, and reduced joint pain, significantly enhancing overall wellness.

Measures IgG and IgA-mediated immune responses to a wide variety of foods, helping individuals pinpoint multiple food sensitivities that could be contributing to chronic symptoms like digestive distress and fatigue.
What’s Measured
Measures IgG and IgA immune responses to common foods such as wheat, dairy, eggs, and gluten, helping to uncover potential overlapping sensitivities and refine dietary strategies.

####  What does the Wheat Zoomer Test measure?
The test evaluates immune responses to gluten, non-gluten wheat proteins, and markers of gut permeability to assess wheat-related sensitivities and digestive health.
####  How do I prepare for this test?
No special preparation is needed. Patients should maintain their regular diet before testing to ensure accurate immune response measurements.
####  Can this test diagnose celiac disease?
While this test detects immune reactivity to gluten, a formal diagnosis of celiac disease may require additional genetic and biopsy testing.
####  What symptoms suggest I need this test?
Symptoms such as digestive distress, joint pain, brain fog, fatigue, and skin conditions may indicate wheat or gluten sensitivity.
####  What should I do if my results show a sensitivity to wheat?
Your provider may recommend a wheat-free diet, gut-healing protocols, and nutritional support to address inflammation and improve overall health.
