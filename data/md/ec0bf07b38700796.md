####  Female Hormones
_Menopause and Perimenopause_
The perimenopause-to-menopause transition is a key phase in women’s health. Declining estrogen and progesterone levels raise risks for cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, insulin resistance, sleep issues, low libido, muscle loss, reduced collagen, cognitive changes, mood swings, and weight gain. The Hormone Zoomer assesses hormone levels and its metabolites highlighting risk profiles, while adrenal HPA axis evaluation refines treatment options for stress management thereby supporting women to navigate this life stage with greater support and resilience.
_Fertility and reproductive health_
For women with fertility issues, PCOS, fibroids, PMS, PMDD, irregular cycles, or endometriosis, the Hormone Zoomer Test assesses adrenal and reproductive hormone imbalances, pinpointing disruptions to help guide tailored treatment.
_Estrogen Dominance_
Estrogen dominance occurs when estrogen levels are high relative to progesterone. This imbalance can worsen symptoms of PMS, painful periods, endometriosis, and fibroids, and can make perimenopause symptoms more intense.
_Estrogen Metabolism and Cancer Risk_
The Hormone Zoomer Test can help understand how your liver metabolizes estrogen. Poor estrogen metabolism can increase the risk of estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, cervical, and uterine cancer.
####  Male Hormones
Testosterone metabolism by 5-alpha reductase can lead to pattern baldness by converting testosterone to DHT, while endocrine disruptors may blunt testosterone’s key effects, such as muscle maintenance or libido, altering its intended function despite normal levels.
####  Hormone Replacement therapy (HRT)
For anyone starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or already on it, monitoring hormone levels and their metabolites is vital. The Hormone Zoomer Test evaluates testosterone for men, from injections, patches, pellets, or gels and estrogen or progesterone for women—from oral doses, vaginal applications, patches, or pellets, ensuring tailored decisions working with your provider.
####  Detox Endocrine Disruptors
Detect toxins that can block hormone receptors and provide lifestyle and supplement suggestions to help and support detox pathways.
####  Sleep Issues
If you’re experiencing sleep disturbances, the Hormone Zoomer Test can provide insight by evaluating diurnal melatonin and cortisol patterns. Reduced melatonin or elevated cortisol levels may dysregulate your circadian rhythm, impairing sleep quality.
####  DHEA deficiency or excess
DHEA, an adrenal hormone, affects health broadly with low levels leading to fatigue, depression, muscle loss, joint pain, low libido, and weak immunity, while high levels may cause acne and excess hair growth. As a precursor to sex hormones, its balance is key. Testing DHEA levels along with its circulating form DHEA-S sheds light on overall adrenal and hormonal health.
##  Vibrant Advantage
The Hormone Zoomer offers a comprehensive evaluation of hormone levels, including cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and endocrine disruptors, helping identify imbalances that impact mood, energy, metabolism, and overall health.

Hormonal imbalances are often overlooked but may be the missing link behind fatigue, weight gain, and mood changes.
Environmental hormone disruptors like BPA and phthalates can interfere with metabolism, fertility, and thyroid function.
Early insight into hormone metabolism helps prevent long-term issues like adrenal dysfunction, infertility, and low energy.
Balanced hormones support energy, weight stability, bone health, stress response, and sleep, key pillars of overall wellness.
When hormone metabolism breaks down, it can trigger excess estrogen, androgen imbalance, and stress-related symptoms.
Identifying root imbalances and environmental contributors supports more precise, effective treatment plans for lasting relief.

Why Is This Important
Hormonal imbalances are often overlooked but may be the missing link behind fatigue, weight gain, and mood changes.
Environmental hormone disruptors like BPA and phthalates can interfere with metabolism, fertility, and thyroid function.
Early insight into hormone metabolism helps prevent long-term issues like adrenal dysfunction, infertility, and low energy.
Balanced hormones support energy, weight stability, bone health, stress response, and sleep, key pillars of overall wellness.
When hormone metabolism breaks down, it can trigger excess estrogen, androgen imbalance, and stress-related symptoms.
Identifying root imbalances and environmental contributors supports more precise, effective treatment plans for lasting relief.

Why It Matters
The Hormone Zoomer analyzes urinary hormone patterns and toxin exposure to uncover hidden causes of fatigue, weight changes, mood symptoms, and therapy resistance. When paired with gut insights, it offers a more complete view of hormone function and systemic health.
The Gut Zoomer detects dysbiosis, inflammation, and microbial imbalance that may interfere with hormone balance through estrogen recirculation and immune activation. When combined with hormone testing, it helps identify overlooked contributors to stubborn symptoms.
Key Insights
Reveals hormone metabolism issues, disrupted cortisol rhythms, and toxin-related interference. With the Gut Zoomer, it helps identify gut-linked hormone recirculation and inflammation that contribute to long-standing fatigue or poor therapy outcomes.
Connects gut health to hormone imbalances like estrogen dominance and androgen disruption. Supports tailored gut-hormone protocols when used alongside the Hormone Zoomer for patients with persistent metabolic or hormonal complaints.
What’s Measured
Measures estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol, melatonin, and their metabolites. Also screens for endocrine disruptors (e.g., BPA, phthalates), bone turnover markers (DPD, PYD), and oxidative stress (8OHdG).
Analyzes gut microbes, digestive health markers, and pathogens that may influence beta-glucuronidase activity, estrogen recirculation, hormone metabolism, and inflammation.

####  What makes the Hormone Zoomer different from other hormone tests?
Unlike saliva or dried urine tests, the Hormone Zoomer uses pooled wet urine and LC-MS/MS + GC-MS/MS technology for highly accurate measurement of both hormones and metabolites, giving a full picture of hormone activity throughout the day.
####  Why are hormone metabolism markers important?
Hormone levels alone don’t tell the full story. The Hormone Zoomer reveals how well your body processes and eliminates hormones, helping identify issues like estrogen dominance, sluggish cortisol clearance, and poor methylation patterns.
####  Can this test help explain why hormone therapy isn’t working?
Yes. It helps uncover hidden disruptors (like BPA or phthalates) that may block hormone receptors, as well as inefficiencies in metabolism that reduce treatment effectiveness, even when hormone levels appear “normal.”
####  Does this test include insights into bone or aging-related risks?
Yes. The Hormone Zoomer includes bone turnover markers (DPD and PYD) to assess bone loss activity and oxidative stress (8OHdG), which is linked to inflammation, cellular aging, and hormone signaling disruption.
####  Will the report include treatment suggestions?
Yes. Every report includes clinical context, visual trend graphs, metabolic ratios, and built-in supplement recommendations based on the patient's hormone profile, making it easy to create a targeted, personalized care plan.
