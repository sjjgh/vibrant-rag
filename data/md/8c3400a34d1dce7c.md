**2. Pre-Test Guidelines:**
No fasting required—maintain your normal diet.
Dietary Considerations: If you are actively consuming gluten, continue your normal diet before testing, as eliminating gluten beforehand may affect results. If you have been avoiding gluten for a long time, your antibody response may be lower or absent. A gluten challenge is not recommended for those who experience severe symptoms.
Medication & Supplement Considerations: No restrictions; however, immunosuppressive medications or biologics may alter test results. Consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns.

**3. Best Collection Practices:**
Ensure the sample is properly sealed and stored according to the provided instructions.
Follow all collection procedures as directed to ensure accurate results.

**4. Seamless Sample Processing:**
Send your sample to our CLIA-certified lab for comprehensive analysis, and work with your healthcare provider to interpret your results and develop a personalized plan for managing celiac disease and gluten sensitivity.
Celiac disease affects about 1 in 100 people worldwide, with many cases remaining undiagnosed for years.
Gluten sensitivity can lead to chronic symptoms like fatigue, digestive discomfort, and joint pain if left untreated.
Testing for gluten-related immune responses offers valuable insights into celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity, which often overlap with other conditions.
By identifying gluten intolerance early, individuals can make informed dietary changes that prevent long-term damage to the intestines.
Celiac disease is linked to a higher risk of autoimmune disorders, infertility, and certain cancers, making early diagnosis crucial.
Avoiding gluten can significantly improve quality of life, reduce inflammation, and help prevent serious complications from undiagnosed celiac disease.
