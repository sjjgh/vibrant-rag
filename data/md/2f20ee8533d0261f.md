####  What does the Neural Zoomer Plus test for?
The Neural Zoomer Plus evaluates antibodies targeting neurological antigens, including myelin proteins, synaptic receptors, and neurotropic viral markers.
####  Do I need to prepare for the test?
No preparation is necessary; patients can follow their daily routine unless otherwise advised by their healthcare provider.
####  How does this test support the diagnosis of neuroinflammatory conditions?
By detecting elevated antibodies, this test supports healthcare providers in distinguishing autoimmune neurological disorders from viral contributors.
####  What do elevated antibodies indicate?
Elevated antibodies may indicate neuroinflammation, demyelination, or synaptic dysfunction, contributing to cognitive and neurological symptoms.
####  How long does it take to receive test results?
Results are typically available within 7–10 business days after the sample is received at the lab.
