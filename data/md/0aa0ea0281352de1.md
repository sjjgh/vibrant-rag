####  Identify the Root Cause of Your Symptoms
Stop guessing what’s behind your bloating, digestive discomfort, brain fog, or chronic fatigue. The Candida + IBS Profile provides clear insights into fungal overgrowth, post-infectious IBS, and autoimmune gut dysfunction, helping you and your provider pinpoint the source of your symptoms.
####  Detect Fungal & IBS Triggers Early
Many gut imbalances go undiagnosed until symptoms become severe. This test detects early signs of Candida overgrowth, gut motility issues, and immune-driven inflammation, allowing for timely intervention and targeted treatment.
####  Take Control of Your Gut Health
Living with unexplained digestive symptoms can be frustrating. The Candida + IBS Profile delivers precise, actionable results, helping you understand what’s affecting your gut so you can take proactive steps toward better health.
####  Personalized Care for Lasting Relief
Generic treatments don’t work for everyone. With detailed insights into your gut health, your provider can develop a personalized plan, including dietary changes, antifungal support, and lifestyle adjustments to restore balance and improve symptoms.
##  The Candida + IBS Profile provides a complete assessment of gut health and fungal overgrowth
Detects Candida species, fungal markers, and gut inflammation biomarkers. Helps identify microbial imbalances contributing to bloating, diarrhea, and IBS-like symptoms, supporting targeted strategies for digestive health and microbiome balance.

####  What does the Candida + IBS Profile test for?
This test evaluates antibodies to Candida species, related fungi, and IBS markers (CdtB and vinculin) to uncover the root causes of digestive and systemic symptoms.
####  Do I need to prepare for the test?
No special preparation is needed. Patients can follow their usual diet and routine unless instructed otherwise by their provider.
####  How can this test help improve my health?
By identifying fungal overgrowth and IBS markers, the test supports tailored interventions to address gut health, reduce inflammation, and enhance overall well-being.
####  What do elevated antibody levels mean?
Elevated antibodies may indicate fungal overgrowth, immune hypersensitivity, or post-infectious IBS mechanisms affecting gut health and motility. Monitoring these levels over time can provide insights into the effectiveness of interventions.
####  How long does it take to receive results?
Results are typically available within 14 business days after the lab receives the sample. Once ready, they are securely shared with your healthcare provider for interpretation and personalized recommendations.
