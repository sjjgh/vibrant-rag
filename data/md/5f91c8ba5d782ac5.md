Identifies the presence of harmful PFAS chemicals, providing critical data on toxic accumulation in the body and its potential impact on long-term health.
Provides a complete view of the body’s toxic burden, helping individuals understand the cumulative impact of PFAS exposure alongside other environmental toxins.
What’s Measured
Measures 21 different PFAS chemicals, including PFOA, PFOS, and other common pollutants that persist in the environment and accumulate in the body over time.
Measures PFAS chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins, and other industrial chemicals, offering a comprehensive look at total toxin exposure.
