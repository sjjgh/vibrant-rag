##  Test for Infections
An infection can be defined as an illness due to pathogens like viruses or bacteria or their toxic products. Pathogens and their toxins are transmitted to a susceptible host via an infected person, animal, or contaminated object.1 Infectious diseases result in an immense global burden that can impact public health and economies.2 Infections can be contracted through environmental sources or human contact and can wreak havoc on various body systems. If not diagnosed, infections can cause chronic inflammation, disease development, and even neurological symptoms. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the transmission and impact of infectious diseases.
**Vibrant has an Infection Panel that can readily detect the presence of various classes of microbes, revealing the root cause of symptoms.**
**Infections play a role in longevity. It has been hypothesized that exposure to infectious diseases during the early stages of life can increase the risk of mortality. 3 Infections cause inflammatory immune reactions and chronic inflammation can increase the risk of atherosclerosis, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. Several studies have associated the chronic inflammation caused due to early-life infections with cardiovascular diseases and increased middle-aged mortality.4**

####  Dr. Patrick Meyer
Patrick M Meyer Sauteur, MD, Ph.D. is part of the University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. His research focuses on pneumonia in children, mycoplasma, Lyme disease, and acute monocutaneous reactions to infections. Mycoplasma pneumonia and Lyme disease are serious infections that can be considered endemic in the USA. Understanding these diseases can help improve diagnostic methods and treatment for the same. Dr. Meyer has worked on and published several papers on Mycoplasma pneumonia.6 Furthermore, he has collaborated with Vibrant America in studying Lyme disease.

####  Dr. Niaz Banaei
Niaz Banaei, MD is a Professor of Pathology and Medicine at Stanford University and is the Director of the Stanford Clinical Microbiology Fellowship and Stanford Global Health Diagnostics Fellowship. He is also the associate program director for the Clinical Pathology training program. His research focuses on the development, assessment, improvement, and clinical impact of novel infectious diseases diagnostics, and immunopathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. Dr. Banaei has worked on and published papers on several infectious diseases including but not limited to Sars-Cov-2, M. tuberculosis, etc.7
##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Antibody Profiling and Prevalence in the US population during the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic
In the study ‘Antibody Profiling and Prevalence in the US population during the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic’ we employed our microarray technology to detect Sars-Cov-2. The method had high sensitivity and specificity, scalability, high fidelity, and reliability which will be critical to the control of the current pandemic.9
####  Serology profile and effects of influenza vaccination on COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’
In our publication ‘Serology profile and effects of influenza vaccination on COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’ we reported that the influenza vaccine does not provide protection against Sars-Cov-2 but may attenuate symptom severity.10
####  An ultra-high‑density protein microarray for high throughput single‑tier serological detection of Lyme disease
In the study 'An ultra‑high‑density protein microarray for high throughput single‑tier serological detection of Lyme disease’ we demonstrated that the Lyme Immunochip is a valid alternative to standard two-tiered testing, with the capability to characterize the antibody profile of Lyme disease patients with enhanced accuracy and reduced turnaround time. Our microarray has the potential to be an accurate, rapid, economical, and universal diagnostic testing platform.11
####  A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients
In the publication ‘A multiplex chemiluminescent immunoassay for serological profiling of COVID-19-positive symptomatic and asymptomatic patients’ we used our microarray technology to detect antibodies against Sars-Cov-2.12
