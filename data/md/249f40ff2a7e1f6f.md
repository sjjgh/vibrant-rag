##  Test for Cardiac Health
Cardiac health involves maintaining the well-being of the heart and blood vessels, which is crucial to prevent heart diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, healthy lifestyle habits and regular cardiac testing are essential to maintain good cardiac health.1,2 Poor cardiac health can lead to detrimental risks such as heart disease, heart attack, stroke, and even death.
Vibrant offers Cardiac Health Panel, which combines multiple markers to assess current risk of heart disease and the CardiaX Test for understanding your genetic predisposition to various cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, insulin resistance, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and dyslipidemia.3
**Aging results in structural changes and functional decline of the cardiovascular system and is therefore one of the major determinants of cardiovascular risks. Increasing age is accompanied by vascular stiffening, plaque formation, reduction of the bioavailability of vasodilators, an increase in vasoconstrictors, altered contractility, and poor cardiac injury repair. 4 These factors lead to the age-associated risk of atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke, thus affecting lifespan.5 **

####  Dr. Suzette Bielinski
Dr. Suzette Bielinski, Ph.D., M.Ed., is a genetic epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota. Dr. Suzette Bielinski research focuses on identifying molecular biomarkers of cardiovascular disease and associated risk factors, as well as understanding the role of genetic variants in drug response. She has identified genetic and protein biomarkers and other clinical factors associated with heart disease, including heart attacks, heart failure, and abnormal heart rhythms, that can be used to improve risk prediction. Dr. Suzette Bielinski believes that understanding individual differences in cardiovascular disease holds the promise of improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease by tailoring medical care to an individual's molecular profile.6

####  Dr. Michael J. Ackerman
Dr. Michael J. Ackerman, M.D., Ph.D., is a pediatric cardiologist at Mayo Clinic; a professor of medicine, pediatrics, and pharmacology at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, and a principal investigator of the cardiovascular disease and aging lab, at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota. His research interests include studying genomics and genotype-phenotype relationships in heritable cardiovascular diseases predisposing to sudden death. Dr. Ackerman and his colleagues have discovered more than 12 genes that can lead to sudden death. This research is now being used to develop genetic tests that can help identify patients who are at risk for developing heart disease and sudden death. Dr. Ackerman believes this research is enabling true personalized/individualized medicine for patients and families with genetic heart rhythms and genetic heart muscle diseases. 7

####  Insights into Cardiovascular Risk and Nutritional Status in Subjects with Wheat-Related Disorders
In our publication, 'Insights into Cardiovascular Risk and Nutritional Status in Subjects with Wheat-Related Disorders', we investigated the prevalence and severity of cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with wheat-related disorders using the Wheat Zoomer (WZ) panel and Coeliac Disease (CD) panel for wheat protein antibodies, as well as a cardiovascular panel. We also analyzed the role of diet and nutrition in managing cardiovascular risk in these populations using the micronutrient panel.8
