##  Test for Nutrients
Nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and fatty acids play vital roles in energy production, hemoglobin synthesis, maintenance of bone health, immune regulation, and protection against oxidative stress.1 As nutrients play such important roles in various biological functions, a proper balance in nutrient levels is very crucial. A marginal lack of a particular nutrient could prove detrimental to the body and could lead to health conditions.1

**Vibrant’s Nutrient test assesses the extracellular and intracellular levels of nutrients as well as genetic predispositions affecting nutrient levels, revealing the root cause of nutritional deficiencies.**
**Nutrition impacts overall wellbeing.**

**A deficiency in B vitamins has been associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, immune alterations, and inflammatory conditions which can give rise to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, cognitive dysfunction, osteoporosis, and methylation disorders. 2 **

**Also, a vitamin E deficiency can reduce cognitive functions, which is implicated in brain aging. 3**
##  Nutrition and Ageing
##  Expert opinions
![Bruce](https://vibrant-wellness.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Category/Bruce.webp?width=328&height=436&name=Bruce.webp)
####  Dr. Bruce Ames
Dr. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., has pioneered the fields of biochemistry and nutritional science. He is a Professor Emeritus of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, at the University of California, Berkeley, and most recently was a Senior Scientist at Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI), and director of their Nutrition & Metabolism Center, USA. According to Dr. Ames, micronutrient deficiencies may result in chronic metabolic disruption, DNA damage, and mitochondrial decay with oxidant leakage and cellular aging. These factors may lead to serious health conditions. Dr. Ames proposed the triage theory, which states that the body has developed a rationing response to shortages of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) throughout evolution. In nutrient deficiency states, the scarce micronutrient in the cells is allotted to proteins essential for short-term survival. Proteins needed for long-term health, including those that protect DNA, lose out and become disabled and which leads to diseases of aging. He believes that micronutrient supplementation is the way to ensure intake of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of micronutrients5.

####  Regan Bailey
Regan Bailey, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D. is an Associate Director of Precision Nutrition for the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture and a professor of Nutrition at Texas A&M University, USA. Her research focuses on improving the methods of measuring nutritional status to optimize health. Bailey developed the first models combining nutrients from foods and dietary supplements to estimate total usual intake. Her work was used to inform the calcium and vitamin D Dietary Reference Intakes and the National Academy reference values. She believes that micronutrient deficiencies are a global concern. Their long-term consequences are not only seen at the individual level but can nationally impact economic development and human capital, making the prevention of micronutrient deficiencies very crucial6.

##  Our Publications, Patents, & Clinical Trials
####  Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism
In our publication, ‘Association of Micronutrients and Prevalence of Antibodies in Hyperthyroidism’, we discuss the role of iodine and selenium in the production and proper metabolism of the thyroid hormone<sup>7</sup>.
####  Effect of Micronutrients on Thyroid Parameters
In our study, ‘Effect of Micronutrients on Thyroid Parameters’, we sought to understand the fine interplay between micronutrients and the thyroid gland and found a strong association between the levels of micronutrients and thyroid markers<sup>8</sup>.
