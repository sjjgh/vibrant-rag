Why It Matters
Identifies specific autoimmune markers early and accurately, enabling personalized treatment plans and improved patient outcomes.
The gut plays a critical role in immune regulation. Imbalances in gut health can contribute to inflammation and trigger autoimmune responses. Gut Zoomer helps identify these underlying triggers.
Key Insights
Provides detailed assessment of patient immune response, offering insights into autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.
Identifies microbial imbalances, digestive dysfunction, and pathogens that may contribute to chronic inflammation, autoimmune reactions, and leaky gut.
What’s Measured
Autoantibodies and antigens (Thyroid Peroxidase, Thyroglobulin, Insulin, Islet Cell Antigens, Myelin Basic Protein, and more). Using advanced bio-chip immunofluorescence and ELISA technology.
Gut commensal microbes, digestive markers, and gut pathogens. Using advanced technologies like RT-PCR, microarray, LC-MS, and GC-MS for precise analysis.

##  FAQ for Autoimmune Zoomer
[ View all FAQs ](https://help.vibrant-wellness.com/hc/en-us)
####  What does the Autoimmune Zoomer test for?
The Autoimmune Zoomer detects autoantibodies and antigens associated with autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and systemic autoimmunity. It provides a detailed immune system analysis to identify potential autoimmune reactivity before symptoms appear.
####  How is this test different from a standard ANA test?
Unlike traditional ANA tests, the Autoimmune Zoomer uses bio-chip immunofluorescence and ELISA technology to simultaneously test ANA and ENA markers, providing higher sensitivity and specificity for autoimmune detection. This reduces false negatives and ensures a more comprehensive evaluation.
####  Who should take the Autoimmune Zoomer test?
This test is ideal for individuals experiencing chronic fatigue, joint pain, skin rashes, digestive issues, or neurological symptoms. It is also recommended for those with a family history of autoimmune diseases or patients with unexplained symptoms that haven’t responded to standard treatments.
####  How does the Autoimmune Zoomer help with treatment?
By identifying specific autoimmune markers early, this test helps providers develop personalized treatment plans to manage immune system dysfunction, prevent disease progression, and improve patient outcomes through targeted interventions and lifestyle adjustments.
####  Do I need to fast or stop medications before taking this test?
No fasting or dietary restrictions are required. However, certain immunosuppressive medications, steroids, or biologics may affect results by altering immunoglobulin levels. Consult your healthcare provider before testing if you are taking any immune-modulating medications.
