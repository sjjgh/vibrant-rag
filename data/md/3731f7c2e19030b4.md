[ View all FAQs ](https://help.vibrant-wellness.com/hc/en-us?__hstc=233546881.0e35fa1f685a9e19e07c584410315c97.1741705001418.1741711860667.1741717824855.3&__hssc=233546881.8.1741717824855&__hsfp=3970764857)
####  Who should consider getting the Lyme Autoimmune Panel test?
Individuals diagnosed with Lyme disease who continue to have symptoms after treatment, such as unexplained joint pain, fatigue, neurological issues, or heart irregularities, should consider this test. It is also recommended for individuals who have had a tick bite, especially in Lyme-prevalent areas, or those experiencing Lyme-like symptoms, to determine if their symptoms are due to an autoimmune response triggered by Lyme disease.
####  How does the Lyme Autoimmune Panel test help in managing chronic Lyme disease symptoms?
The Lyme Autoimmune Panel identifies specific antibodies against Lyme disease antigens that can trigger or mimic autoimmune conditions like arthritis, carditis, and neuroborreliosis. By providing a precise diagnosis, the test helps guide targeted interventions, such as anti-inflammatory diets and lifestyle changes, reducing unnecessary antimicrobial treatments and improving long-term health outcomes.
####  What are the key markers measured by the Lyme Autoimmune Panel, and what do they indicate?
The test measures 11 different markers, including LFA-1α, MMP-10, ECGF, ApoB100, T-span7, and D1R, among others. These markers help identify inflammation, immune response, tissue breakdown, blood vessel changes, and nerve involvement, providing a comprehensive picture of the immune system’s activity and aiding in the accurate diagnosis and management of Lyme-related autoimmune conditions.
####  How does early detection of Lyme-linked autoimmune responses benefit patients?
Early detection of Lyme-linked autoimmune responses is crucial for preventing the progression of post-infectious Lyme Autoimmune into severe manifestations. By identifying these responses early, healthcare providers can initiate timely, targeted treatments, minimizing long-term complications, promoting a quicker return to health, and significantly improving the disease’s overall outcome.
