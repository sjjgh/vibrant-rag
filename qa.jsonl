{"kind": "qa", "question": "What is the Gut Zoomer and how does it work?", "answer": "The Gut Zoomer is an advanced stool-based test that analyzes over 300 markers across the gut microbiome, digestive health, inflammation, immune response, and more. Unlike standard gut tests, it evaluates not only bacteria, but also fungi, viruses, parasites, and gut metabolites. Using cutting-edge technology like multiplex PCR, ELISA, and LC-MS, the Gut Zoomer maps imbalances in your gut ecosystem that may be driving chronic symptoms, such as bloating, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, food sensitivities, and more. The result is a detailed, actionable report that links gut dysfunction to systemic issues, helping practitioners and patients make precise, targeted interventions.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer", "doc_id": "ff2762fd653e8f51", "section": "FAQs for Gut Zoomer Test", "source_format": "md_faq"}

{"kind": "qa", "question": "How can Gut Zoomer help identify the root cause of chronic health issues?", "answer": "Many chronic conditions, from fatigue and autoimmune disorders to mood imbalances and hormone disruption, can originate in the gut. Gut Zoomer uncovers the microbial and metabolic imbalances that often go undetected in conventional testing. For example, it can reveal overgrowth of pathogens like Candida glabrata, inflammation markers like S100A12 or MMP-9, or elevated beta-glucuronidase, an enzyme that can increase re-circulation of toxins and hormones. By connecting symptoms to specific imbalances, it helps practitioners build root-cause protocols that target dysfunction at the source, not just the symptoms.", "url": "https://vibrant-wellness.com/tests/gut-health/gut-zoomer", "doc_id": "ff2762fd653e8f51", "section": "FAQs for Gut Zoomer Test", "source_format": "md_faq"}
